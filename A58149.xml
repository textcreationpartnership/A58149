         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </gap>lear that the Holy Truths of God are by him ſtricken at through my ſides, and that many poor deluded people are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by his plauſible miſcarriages; I could not do leſs in
<pb facs="tcp:65253:3"/>
juſtice and conſcience, then to ſhew my ſelf in publique, both for the vindication of the cauſe of God, that it may not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by my ſilence, and that I may in ſome meaſure undeceive the light-headed, tottering and unſtable people. Tis very true, I was decoy'd into this ingagement, there being onely at firſt deſired of me to write down my reſolves unto certain Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for the private ſatisfaction of ſome ſtaggering perſons; which being rudely becauſe ſuddenly conceived and drawn up, not having time to clothe that Embryon in any curious dreſs, my adverſary by ſubtilty ſeiſeth upon it, and after a twelve monthes travel brings forth <hi>rudem indigeſtamque molem,</hi> a miſhapen anſwer unto (ſome part onely of) my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves, and ſteals it through the Preſs.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe I was ſurpriſed in that, I held it needful to vindicate both my ſelf and it, which howſoever in the outward accoutrements it be ragged and torn, yet for the matter of it I doubt not but that it hath truth to ſupport it.</p>
            <p>But yet alas! who am I that I ſhould adventure to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take this task, being leſs then the leaſt of all the Saints, and eſpecially ſeeing the ſubject matter thereof is of ſo great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment? The well is deep, and my fathoming is but ſhallow, I muſt confeſs I am ſo low a man in the eſteem of the world, and ſo obſcure every way, that I fear the truth may ſuſtain ſome loſs through my weakneſs; my onely hopes are that that God who begun that good work in and by me to the ſatisfaction of a few, will now perfect that work which he hath begun to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving of others.</p>
            <p>And whereas cuſtome hath ſo far prevailed for the dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Books to ſome noble Perſonages, my next hopes are that your Lordſhip will be graciouſly pleaſed to honour me your unworthy ſervant ſo far as that I may ſhelter my ſelf under your Honours Patronage. And I do the rather take hold of this occaſion upon this enſuing conſideration.</p>
            <p>Right Honourable, Twice have I had a large experience of your goodneſs and bounty in the ſetling of me in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage
<pb facs="tcp:65253:3"/>
of <hi>Haſilbury Bryan,</hi> firſt in recommending me to the Committee of the County upon the delinquency of the incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent, and afterwards upon his death by the free granting of me your Lordſhips Preſentation thereunto, notwithſtanding the interpoſition of ſome to the contrary; hereby freeing me from many of thoſe ſnares, wherein many of our coat are (in theſe corrupt times) very much intangled: and hitherto I had no opportunity to give any evidence of that thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I owe unto your Lordſhip. I know it were injuſtice in me to ſmother it, for, <hi>ſi ingratum dixeris omnia dixeris.</hi> Neither could I ſo ſatisfie my ſelf, in bare expreſſions, and that in a private manner, to teſtifie a thankful acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unleſs I did withal ſet the ſame upon record; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hat as this poor tract of mine paſſeth abroad in the world, it may ſtand up every where as a publique teſtimony of my private obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations unto your Honour. And however I am confident you take no pleaſure to have your goodneſs publiſhed, but that you are rather ſatisfied with the peace of a good conſcience then with the gawdy outſide of ſpecious Encomiums, yet it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes an ingenuous ſpirit to profeſs how and by what hand mercies are reach't forth unto him. God make me truly thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him for his good providence over me herein, and for all other his mercies towards me.</p>
            <p>And I could heartily wiſh, that all the world might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand your noble diſpoſition and Chriſtian converſation in the midſt of your worthy family, how you make your ſelf a pattern unto them in godlineſs and honeſty, both in publique and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, that ſo every man might be provoked by your gracious example, and therein as in a glaſs behold how immeaſurablely you exceed the painted ſepulchres of this our age, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to God, in giving him the honour due unto his great name; as alſo in reference to man, by a diſtributive juſtice rendring to thoſe who have a dependency on your Lordſhip according to their deſerts.</p>

            <p>I Cannot do leſs then give thee an account how this whiffler hath dragd me on the ſtage againſt my will: It was not my ambition (eſpecially in this cenſorious age wherein we live, and at beſt privy to mine own weakneſs) ever to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in Print amongſt a croud of ſuch learned writers, I might perhaps have gone for ſomewhat, when as now my nothingneſs will be diſcerned. But the occaſion of it was this. About two years ſince, at what time this Pamphleter had a meeting-place in the pariſh of <hi>Whitchurch</hi> commonly called <hi>Cuckolds-pit,</hi> where moſt Lords dayes divers of that Pariſh and of other places adjacent came to hear his teachings: He had then Proſelyted divers of <hi>Milton Abbis,</hi> (where, amongſt others I was one of their weekly Lecturers) to the receiving of his crude dictates, and many were dipt by him; who having ſuckt in and digeſted that venom of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptization, eaſily then might he perſwade with them to ingurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate any of his other principles. So that he adventured to tender to them eight poſitions, which I have cauſed to be placed at the end of this book, which they likewiſe were to receive from him as ſo many neceſſary truths: they were at a ſtand as unſatisfied what to do. But one who was indeed a wel-wiſher to Religion, and an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man, took a copy of thoſe Poſitions and brought them to me to <hi>Haſilbury,</hi> and deſired my opinion of them; which when I had read I gave him my thoughts of them ſeverally: But then he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſired of me, that I would deliver my judgement of them in writing, which within 3 or 4 dayes I did, and gave to him the rough draught which I at firſt did make, having no other copy thereof in mine hands, (a particular whereof you have affixed to the end of this book ſubſequent to his Poſitions) which when he had received, he communicated it to the fraternity at <hi>Milton</hi> who were <hi>Tazwels</hi> conſtant and confident hearers; which when they had peruſed, their former heſitation did amount unto a flat oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition againſt his Poſitions, and then they began to decline his teachings; which he perceiving, and being informed of thoſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of mine, he came to <hi>Milton</hi> among his old diſciples, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to have a copy of thoſe papers, which at laſt he obtained, and a twelve moneth after about the beginning of <hi>December</hi> 1656 ſent me one of his printed Pamphlets; I was (I muſt confeſs) at the firſt ſight thereof amuzed and amazed, not well reſolving what to
<pb facs="tcp:65253:5"/>
do, as to what was paſt, nor as to what was to come.

            <p>GOd did in all eternity before any thing was brought forth,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in order behold all things that ſhould or would be, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as if they had then been in being: God ſaw man created, and man fallen, Chriſt crucified, and fallen man redeemed, and alſo the means of ſalvation tendred.</p>
            <p>God alſo ſaw ſome men embracing this means, and ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it as God ſaw ſome men embracing this means, thoſe he elected in Chriſt from the foundation of the world through ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of the Spirit to everlaſting life.</p>
            <p>So God ſaw ſome men rejecting the means of ſalvation, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> in ſin and unbelief, yet haply not without the exact form of Godlineſs, but denying the power; thoſe he reprobated to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting deſtruction from the foundation of the world.</p>
            <p>Thoſe whom God hath elected unto life and ſalvation, ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> finally fall or come to condemnation, the ſubtilty of Sathan, the policie of man, nor the corruption of nature, ſhall never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt them.</p>
            <p>Thoſe whom God hath reprobated to condemnation ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> be ſaved, Chriſts mercy and means ſhall never ſave them; yet God is not the cauſe of mans condemnation, neither Reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the cauſe of unbelief, but mans deſtruction is of himſelf, and unbelief of the devil.</p>
            <p>All men are ſometimes convinced of ſin and the ſtate of nature,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> and are made alive, by the work of the Spirit of grace to every man in the world: God alſo giveth a Talent to every man, and power to improve it, but mans not improving it, when receiving it with a power, is the cauſe of mans deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Chriſt hath redeemed all men from the firſt tranſgreſſion, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> croſſed the ſcore of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, yet the pollution of that ſin is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all men, but not the condemnation alſo: <hi>Adam</hi> did not fall for want of power, but for conſenting to Sathan, not improving the power.</p>
            <p>Chriſt hath laid his life, and ſhed his bloud for every man in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> world; yet not intending thereby to ſave every man, for Chriſt came to fulfill, not to croſs his Fathers Will; and this is his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Will, never to ſave thoſe whom he hath reprobated from eternity for diſobedience and rebellion.</p>

            <p>VVE cannot but wonder that the Grandees of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have ſeemed, as <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. to wink at the ſpront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Errors of theſe times, and not rather to have (<hi>Cant.</hi> 12.16.) <hi>killed the foxes while little,</hi> and (<hi>Eſa.</hi> 14.29.) <hi>cruſht the ſerpent in the root;</hi> for doubtleſs they in their grave wiſdoms do prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foreſee that ſuch Meteors or <hi>Ignes fatui</hi> are more eaſily ſuppreſt by ſlightings and contempt then by ſtrength of oppoſition; neither will they honour the broachers or fomenters with any condigne puniſhment, leſt they ſhould unjuſtly glory in a pretended perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and ſo their rabble might the more increaſe under af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of ſingularity; for ſurely it is very viſible to all exact ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers, that thoſe who were the prime promoters, incendiaries, and blew the coals firſt of theſe ſtrange opinions, they have many of them either withdrawn from the heat of the conteſt, and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the cauſe, or elſe have changed their judgements, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe are ſo divided amongſt themſelves, that many of them know not whom to follow, whether <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Apollo,</hi> or <hi>Cephas,</hi> but leave their Conventicles to be gulled and deluded by the dregs of men, ſuch as wiſemen would diſdain (<hi>Iob</hi> 30.1.) <hi>to have ſet with the dogs of their ſlock,</hi> an evident ſymptome that their kingdom is of no long time for ſtanding for <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.25. <hi>If a kingdom, &amp;c. and if Satan caſt out Satan, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What particular opinions theſe fanatick ſpirits do maintain, (beſides rebaptization) I have been hitherto bleſt from entring into their ſecrets (<hi>Gen.</hi> 49.6.) until this week a friend of mine preſented me with a diſh of their crude and unſavoury Poſitions, no better then Coloquintida. That I may well ſay of them <hi>mors in olla</hi> (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.40.) <hi>death is in the pot;</hi> but I conceive it well beſpeaks what qualified perſons they are from whence they come, <hi>Similes habent labra lactucas,</hi> like lips like lettices.</p>
            <p>They dropt I believe from the pen of a younger brother in profeſſion; ſo that I reſolve to wink at ſmall faults; and though the ill digeſting and compoſing of them will not deſerve a Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars eye, much leſs anſwer; yet becauſe (if it be poſſible) that
<pb facs="tcp:65253:7"/>
the Authour may not further befool himſelf, or further delude his over credulous proſelytes, <hi>and lead captive</hi> (2 Tim. 3.6.) <hi>ſilly women laden with ſin,</hi> I will draw a line of confutation over his more remarkable Errors, and willingly paſs by his ſmaller faults of incongruous or improper expreſſions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I do conſent that the moſt holy and high God, from all (not in) Eternity, by one ſole and ſingle act did ſee all whatſoever he purpoſed to do, or permitted to be done by any of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures he intended to create; for elſe he could not be Omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, Omnipreſent, Infinite and Eternal.</p>
            <p>But whereas it is ſaid;</p>
            <p>That God ſaw ſome men embracing the means of ſalvation, and thoſe he elected in Chriſt, from the foundation of the world to everlaſting life: this is ſo far from ſoundneſs that it is flat <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gianiſm,</hi> an old Hereſie exploded forth of the Church for many ages ſince; by which it muſt be concluded, that the eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Gods unchangeable election, muſt be dependent on the intervention of mans liberty of willing and working; but no proof from Scripture brought to evidence it, nor appearance of any colour of reaſon. Whereas the Scripture when it ſpeaks of election, makes it to be altogether independent on the creature, or from ought at all wrought by or in the creature, but wholly reſting for the ground thereof in the boſome and holy will of God himſelf; and therefore it is called, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.5. <hi>the good pleaſure of his will,</hi> and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.11. <hi>the purpoſe and counſel of his will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay ſo abſolute and irrelative is this decree of election from any thing out of God beſides his <hi>good pleaſure,</hi> as to be any motive or incentive for which God elects, as a meritorius or a procuring ground or cauſe of it, that even Chriſt himſelf is excluded, as for whoſe merit man ſhould be elected, and therefore we are ſaid to be elected in Chriſt, not for Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But becauſe Socratical diſcourſes are not ſo convincing, I ſhall produce ſome irrefragable Arguments, to which if the adverſe party ſhall give any the leaſt colour of anſwer to ſatisfaction, then I ſhall ſay, as they believe, that learning is good for nothing but to puffe men up, and gull the world; but till that be done (which I am certain will never be) I ſhall bleſs the God of my ſalvation, <hi>who (Epheſ.</hi> 4.8, 11.) <hi>hath given ſuch gifts unto men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Arg.</hi> If the riſe of our election be grounded in the free grace of God, then it is not upon Gods foreſight of mans embracing of
<pb facs="tcp:65253:8"/>
the means of ſalvation: but it is founded on the meer mercy and free grace of God: therefore not upon the foreſight of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of the means. The firſt propoſition or major, is unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable, for that there is but one cauſe to produce the effect: The ſecond propoſition or minor, <hi>viz.</hi> that our election is founded on the meer mercy and free grace of God, ſee for proof hereof, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.7, 8. <hi>The Lord thy God hath choſen thee to be a ſpecial peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple unto himſelf,</hi> the Lord did not ſet his love upon, or chooſe you, becauſe you were more in number, &amp;c. but becauſe the Lord loved you; where the ſingle love of God is pitcht upon as the cauſe of their election, excluſively from any other outward cauſes. See further <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.15. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.15.21. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11, 18, 21. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.5, 11. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Arg.</hi> If the Patriarch <hi>Iacob</hi> was elected meerly out of grace, without any reſpect had to any of his faith, works, or uſe of means, then all others are likewiſe ſo elected, for there is the one alike motive for the election of all as of one.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Iacob</hi> was elected meerly out of the good will of God, without any reſpect to faith, works, or the uſe of means, at leaſt for the moving of God to elect him; Therefore all others are ſo likewiſe elected.</p>
            <p>The minor propoſition is confirmed out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11. <hi>for the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpoſe of God according to election might ſtand, not of works, but of him that calleth, It was ſaid, the elder ſhall ſerve the younger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Arg.</hi> If the decree of election be abſolute without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect had to faith, works, or means. Then God did not elect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a foreſight of the embracing of the means: but the decree of election is abſolute, &amp;c. Therefore.</p>
            <p>See for proof, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.5, 6, 7. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4, 5, 11. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.16. and 22.14.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Arg.</hi> If faith and works be the fruits and effects of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then they are no wayes cauſes of it, for which God ſhould elect; but they are fruits and effects, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. <hi>as many as were ordained unto life believed, Epheſ.</hi> 2.4, 7, 8, 9, 13.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Arg.</hi> If our foreſeen faith, works, or embracing of the means, were the cauſe of our election, they ſhould be likewiſe the cauſe of our vocation and juſtification: but the later is falſe, therefore the firſt. The major is proved by that undeniable axiome.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65253:8"/>
               <hi>Quicquid eſt cauſa cauſae eſt cauſa etiam cauſati,</hi> That which is the cauſe of a cauſe, is alſo a cauſe of the thing cauſed <hi>(i. e.)</hi> of the effect.</p>
            <p>The minor is proved, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. <hi>juſtified freely by his grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Arg.</hi> If our election were dependent on mans embracing of the means, then theſe abſurdities would follow.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then the will of God ſhould be moved and determined by an external cauſe <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the firſt cauſe ſhould be ordered and guided by the ſecond, and thereby the firſt is made the ſecond cauſe and <hi>e contra;</hi> which is againſt the rules of all Philoſophy and Divinity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God hereby is ſuppoſed to be capable of paſſion, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> when thus moved, but God is altogether immutable and impaſſible.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Then there ſhould be ſomewhat in the creature out of God, before, greater, and better then God, becauſe that every cauſe is before and better then the effect.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If there might be imagined to be any thing in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which might move God to the decreeing or appointing of this or that, then it would follow that the actings or iſſues of things have not a dependence upon the decree of God, contrary to <hi>Iam.</hi> 3.37.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Then man might have juſt cauſe of boaſting in himſelf.</p>
            <p n="6">6. What then would become of children dying in infancy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had the uſe of faith or works, or any embracing of the means, and which never were to have a being to act? therefore they were never to be foreſeen.</p>
            <p>For the third Poſition, That God ſaw ſome men rejecting the means of ſalvation, continuing in ſin and unbelief, thoſe he repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated to everlaſting deſtruction: But this hath the like unſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it as the former of election, there being no other ground or reaſon aſſigned for it, either of ſin or unbelief, or rejecting of the means, but the meer good pleaſure of Gods moſt holy and righteous Will, who will do with his creature what he will do, neither can any expoſtulate, <hi>why haſt thou done thus? Eſa.</hi> 45.9.</p>
            <p>It is true that ſin and unbelief, and the rejecting of the means, are juſt cauſes why God decrees ſuch perſons to hell and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal torments, but yet not the cauſes of their reprobation; that is ſolely and ſingly in the good pleaſure of his Will, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.5. which I prove by theſe Arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb facs="tcp:65253:9"/>1. <hi>Arg.</hi> That which the holy Ghoſt in the Scripture aſcribes unto the ſole will and good pleaſure of God, that we are not to aſſign other cauſes to: But the Scripture aſſigns reprobation ſolely to Gods will. Therefore. For proof of the minor propoſition ſee theſe texts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. <hi>whom he will he hardeneth.</hi> ver. 20, 21. <hi>Nay but O man! who art thou that replyeſt againſt God? ſhall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, why haſt thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the ſame lump to make one veſſell unto honour and another unto diſhonour?</hi> ver. 22. <hi>What if God willing to ſhew his wrath, and make his power known, endured with much long-ſuffering the veſſels of wrath fitted</hi> (or made up) <hi>for deſtruction?</hi> Matth. 11.26. <hi>Even ſo O Father, for ſo it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good in thy ſight.</hi> Matth. 10.15. <hi>Is it not lawful to do what I will with mine own?</hi> ver. 16. <hi>Many called, few choſen.</hi> Prov. 16.4. <hi>The Lord hath made all things for himſelf, yea even the wicked for the day of evil.</hi> Rom. 9.11, 12, 13. <hi>for the children being not yet born.</hi> ver. 17. <hi>for this ſame purpoſe have I raiſed thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Arg.</hi> That which is the efflux and conſequent of Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cannot be the cauſe of it: But ſin, unbelief, and rejecting the means is the efflux and conſequent of Reprobation. Therefore.</p>
            <p>The major is as clear as the ſun. The minor propoſition is proved from theſe texts, Math. 11.25, 26. <hi>I thank thee father, &amp;c. for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight.</hi> He hid thoſe things not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly but inwardly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.36, 37. Chriſt to the Capernaites, <hi>I ſaid unto you that ye alſo have ſeen me &amp; believed not: all that the father giveth me ſhall come to me;</hi> ſignifying that they are not given to him of the father, and therefore reprobated. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.46, 47. Chriſt to the Phariſees, <hi>If I ſay the truth, why do ye not believe me? he that is of God heareth Gods word, ye therefore hear them not becauſe ye are not of God, (i.e.)</hi> ye are reprobates, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.26. <hi>Ye believe not becauſe ye are not of my ſheep (i. e.)</hi> not of the number of my elect, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.39, 40. Of the whole company of the Jews; <hi>Therefore they could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, becauſe Eſaias ſaid, he hath blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, viz.</hi> God according to his decree, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.18. <hi>whom he will he hardens,</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 33. <hi>Behold, I lay in Sion a ſtumbling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone and rock of offence. Rom.</hi> 11.7, 8. <hi>the election hath obtained it, the reſt are hardened; for God hath given them the ſpirit of ſlumber &amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8. <hi>which ſtumble at the word, being diſobedient, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto alſo they were appointed.</hi>

            <p n="3">
               <pb facs="tcp:65253:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>3. <hi>Arg.</hi> If ſin and unbelief, and rejecting of the means of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, are the onely cauſes why God reprobates any, then there is no ſuch myſtery in the decree of reprobation, neither are Gods waies herein ſo unſearchable and paſt finding out, but that the true and undoubted cauſe may be aſſigned: But yet they are my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious and unſearchable. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.14. <hi>What ſhall we ſay then, is there unrighteouſneſs with God? God forbid, Rom.</hi> 1.33, 34. <hi>O the depth of the riches of the wiſdom and knowledge of God, how unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able are his judgements, and his waies paſt finding out! for who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been his Counſellour?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Arg.</hi> If the foreſight of ſin and unbelief, and rejecting the means of ſalvation, be the cauſes of Reprobation, then theſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities will unavoidably follow.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That no child dying in infancy can poſſibly be reprobated.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Neither ſuch Gentiles, or Turks, Indians, or Salvages, that never heard of Chriſt, who never enjoyed the Goſpel, nor ever had the means tendred to them; <hi>for how can they believe in him on whom they have not heard? Rom.</hi> 10. and how can they reject that which was never tendred unto them? as many nations in the world, <hi>who are ſtrangers from the life of God, Ephe.</hi> 1.12.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If the foreſight of ſin ſhould be the cauſe of Reprobation, then the elect ſhould be equally lyable to the decree of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation as the Reprobates themſelves; they all being alike in the corrupt maſs and lump of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.21, 22, 23, 24. <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.19, 20. <hi>If ye were of the world, &amp;c. Epheſ.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. <hi>children of wrath as well as others, Rom.</hi> 3.10. <hi>and there is none righteous, no not one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Then <hi>Paul</hi> was miſtaken, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11. in not aſſigning ſin to be the cauſe of Reprobation.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The ſame Apoſtle then anſwered very unſoundly to thoſe objections, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.13, 14.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, if God reprobated <hi>Eſau</hi> becauſe he hated him, then he was unjuſt.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>Why doth he yet find fault, for who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted his will?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For he might in one word have anſwered to both the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſaid, that ſin was the cauſe of reprobating both of <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> but he ſaith the contrary, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>When they had done neither good nor evil, Iacob have I loved, and Eſau have I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Mal.</hi> 1.2.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb facs="tcp:65253:10"/>6. Hereby we confine Gods infinite ſoveraignty over his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to the narrow ſcantling of our ſubordinate power, as though he might not do with his own what he liſts without our controll, and not make a veſſel either of honour or of diſhonour, unleſs he were accountable to us for the reaſon of his ſo doing.</p>
            <p>For the fourth and fifth Poſitions, Theſe may paſs with a grain of Salt, &amp; bating ſome impropriety in the expreſſions; and I am not ſo at leiſure to teach ſuch men to expreſs themſelves after a Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical manner, either in their teaching or writing.</p>
            <p>For the ſixth Theſis, I muſt ingenuouſly confeſs, it is ſuch a Myſtery or Paradox, and ſo involved with ſeeming contradictions, that I want an <hi>Oedipus</hi> to unriddle the meaning of it; I have been a little acquainted with the opinions of the <hi>Pelagians, Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelagians, Papiſts, Arminians, Socinians,</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and amongſt them all can obſerve none of them jumping in with this mans judgement, for thus he writes;</p>
            <p>[All men are ſometimes convinced of ſin, and the ſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;] What his meaning is by the ſtate of nature, I cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine; If his ſenſe be, that every man is at one time or other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that by nature he is a child of wrath and diſobedience, and dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, and ſo tis falſe: for moſt men have not ſuch convictions. Next</p>
            <p>[And are made alive by the works of the ſpirit] by this all men ſhould be actually ſaved, <hi>for if in Chriſt</hi> (1 Cor. 15.22.) <hi>all are made alive that are alive, and that he that is alive liveth unto God through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> Rom. 6.11. <hi>then</hi> (as Chriſt himſelf) <hi>ſuch dye no more, ſin hath no more dominion over them</hi> Rom. 6.9. <hi>for they live unto the Lord,</hi> Rom. 14.8. and 1 Joh. 3.9. <hi>his ſeed remaineth in him. Being born again,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.23. <hi>not of corruptible ſeed but of incorruptible, by the word of God which liveth and abideth for ever.</hi> Next.</p>
            <p>[And Chriſt rendreth the light of the Spirit of Grace to every man in the world] Its true we have ſome expreſſions <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.9. <hi>that Chriſt lighteth every man that cometh into the world,</hi> but that is to be underſtood of the common light of nature, or the actings of reaſon, as the two next following verſes do evince, <hi>for the world knew him not, and his own received him not,</hi> they had not the ſpirit of grace and faith; <hi>for</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.2. <hi>all men have not faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how doth Chriſt tender the light of the Spirit of grace to
<pb facs="tcp:65253:10"/>
every man? ſurely after that ordinary manner that God hath ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, to wit, the preaching of the Goſpel, <hi>for Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>faith cometh by hearing, and how ſhall they hear without a Preacher?</hi> then that is apparently falſe, for it is too well known that there are many thouſand thouſands in the world, yea divers nations which never enjoyed the bleſſing to hear of Chriſt, or the Spirit of grace, but <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.12. <hi>lived without a God in this world,</hi> and at laſt ſhall go (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.19.) <hi>unto the generations of their fathers, and never ſee light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the meaning be that Chriſt tendreth the light of the ſpirit of grace inwardly and after an extraordinary manner, this is but <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titio principii</hi> (as they ſay in the Schooles) a plain begging of the queſtion, without any proof of Scripture, or probability in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reaſon.</p>
            <p>Nay it is flat againſt the Scripture, <hi>for Luke</hi> 16.19. <hi>they have Moſes and the Prophets they are to hear them. Eſa.</hi> 8.26. <hi>to the law and to the teſtimony, &amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet</hi> 1.19. <hi>We have a more ſure word of propheſie, whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that ſhineth in a dark place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next, [God alſo giveth a Talent to every man, and power to improve it, but man not improving it when received with a power, is the cauſe of mans deſtruction.] Now what weight this talent bears with this Dictator, or what power is given unto frail men to improve it, and how far and to what or whom either of theſe talents or power is extended, when he hath better ſtudied the point, and comes to underſtand his own meaning, if he pleaſe then to communicate it, he ſhall be ſure to receive a further anſwer; but in the mean time, (by way of Anticipation) if his, ſenſe be as I conjecture through his clouded and dark expreſſions.</p>
            <p>That God hath afforded ſufficient means of grace and power to improve that means to every man whereby they may come to the knowledge of the truth and ſo be ſaved, then I utterly deny it; and my ground of ſuch denial reſts upon theſe enſuing Arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Arg.</hi> If God do purpoſely for the raiſing of his own glory harden ſome, blind others, and make fat the hearts of many, then a ſufficient means of ſalvation nor power to uſe the ſame is adminiſtred to all indifferently: But God doth blind ſome, hardens others, and makes fat. Therefore.</p>
            <p>The major or firſt propoſition is undeniable, becauſe blinding, hardening, and making fat, is deſtructive to the uſe of means.
<pb facs="tcp:65253:11"/>
The minor or ſecond propoſition is proved from theſe expreſs texts, <hi>Ex.</hi> 4.21. and 7.3. and 14.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.18. <hi>whom he will he hardeneth, Ex.</hi> 9.16. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.17. <hi>even for this ſame purpoſe have I raiſed thee up. Ioh.</hi> 12.40. <hi>he hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their hearts, that they ſhould not ſee with their eyes, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand with their hearts, &amp;c. Eſa.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7. <hi>election hath obtained it, the reſt are blinded. Eſa.</hi> 6.10. <hi>make the hearts of this people fat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Arg.</hi> If God willingly ſuffers Nations to walk in their own wayes, and winkes at, or lets them alone in their ſins and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, then God doth not exhibite a ſufficiency of means, nor inables them with a power of acceptation of life and ſalvation. But the firſt is true, therefore the latter. For the proof of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor is unneceſſary; for the minor, ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 14.16. and 17.30.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Arg.</hi> If the preaching of Chriſt crucified in the doctrine of the Goſpel, be the onely, ordinary, ſufficient means to bring men to life and to ſalvation; and that many nations never enjoyed that means, then God hath not afforded a ſufficiency of means to all men: but the firſt is true, therefore the latter.</p>
            <p>That the Goſpel is the onely ordinary means, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>How ſhall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? &amp;c. Acts</hi> 4.12. <hi>there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we muſt be ſaved. Ioh.</hi> 14.6. <hi>No man cometh to the Father but by the Son.</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.12. <hi>He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son hath not life.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>One mediator between God and man, the man Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> Now that many nations want this means tis too evident, and therefore no ſufficiency.</p>
            <p>The Seventh Poſition, That Chriſt hath redeemed all men from the firſt tranſgreſſion, and croſt the ſcore of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well interpret what this dreamer means, for if his ſenſe ſhould be by way of limitation [in all men] to all the elect of men, then I imbrace his Poſition, and ſhould much enlarge it.</p>
            <p>But I ſuſpect worſe that he covertly denies the being of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin, ſecretly inſinuating, that the death of Chriſt hath blotted out (<hi>Col.</hi> 2.14.) <hi>that hand-writing that was againſt us,</hi> from any further imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, or obligation unto puniſhment, onely the guilt and pollution thereof ſtill remains inherent in us, However it is, I will ſhoot at rovers, and adventure an argument or two in defence of the truth.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb facs="tcp:65253:11"/>1. <hi>Arg.</hi> That unto which the Scripture doth apply the name and nature of ſin, deſerving puniſhment, that without controverſie muſt be ſin indeed. But unto original ſin both the name and nature of ſin are applyed in the Scripture; Therefore. For proof hereof ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12, 14, 16, 19. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7, 8. and 8.13. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.14.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Arg.</hi> If temporal death hath been the lot of every one which yet hath not ſinned after the ſimilitude of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion, then there is original ſin ſtill in being in reſpect of puniſhment; for <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>the wages of ſin is death,</hi> and every ſin is either actuall or originall: but temporal death hath been the lot of many who yet have not ſinned actually, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. and this we may ſee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced in the death of Infants which die without actual ſin. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>The laſt Poſition is, Chriſt hath laid his life and ſhed his bloud for every man in the world. In this likewiſe the novice leads me in a miſt; for if his meaning be, that the death of Chriſt and the ſhedding of his bloud is ſufficient for every man in the world, but effectuall onely to thoſe to whom it is intended, then I joyn with him; but if he be otherwiſe minded, then the cloſe of that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition trips up the heels of the former part.</p>
            <p>But I could have heartily wiſht that this Seraphical Doctor had not ſo magiſterially dogmatized, and after an Apoſtolical manner ſat in his Cathedral Chair, by delivering his dictates like an <hi>ipſe dixit,</hi> I ſay unto you; but rathet that he had endeavoured to have proved out of the ſacred Scriptures what he hath ſo crudely venti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated; ſo might we better have tryed the ſpirits whether they be of God or no, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.1. Truly I do profeſs, by what I find in theſe poſitions, I cannot diſcern of what ſect he is, for by what he writes he is neither pure <hi>Pelagian, Papiſt, Arminian, Socinian,</hi> nor <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt,</hi> but a hotch-porch of them all jumbled together. And that as it is written of <hi>Mahomet</hi> at the firſt, he framed his <hi>Alchoran</hi> by the advice of <hi>Sergius</hi> the Monk a renagado, partly of the Jews, partly of the Chriſtians, and partly of the Gentiles opinions, ſo hath this Evangeliſt compoſed his doctrinals.</p>
            <p>So that in this we may ſee what fruits may be expected at <hi>Cockolds-pit,</hi> and all ſuch places of ſuch illiterate and confuſed aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, <hi>ex ungue leon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Be not wiſe in your own conceit;</hi> for there is more hope of a fool than of ſuch a one, you might perhaps have deſiſted from ſoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring above the clouds, and thus to pry into <hi>Arcana imperii,</hi> and to intrude your ſelf as one of Gods Cabinet-Councel, whereas your parts and gifts (too well known) conſidered, you had need of milk your ſelf,<note place="margin">Heb. 5.12.</note> and not to give ſuch ſtrong meat unto your ſeduced Proſelytes; At leaſt more correſponding would it have been to your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition, to have kept within your own ſphear, and if you had met with any temptation to more ſublime ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to have drawn back the reins with that ingenious acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, <hi>I am no Prophet, neither am I a Prophets ſon,</hi>

an heard-man, and a gatherer of wild figs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But probable it is, you were tainted with that Epidemical diſeaſe a wanton itch of being a — in print.</p>
            <p>And whereas for the giving vent to that exuberant humour you could pitch upon no other object but my ſelf to make your Antagoniſt, I do (though with much reluctancy, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to my own wants and imperfections) undertake the defence of that truth, which in this Pamphlet of yours you have much depraved and eclipſed by your falſe gloſſes and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted interpretations, and therein before I undertake the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of your Caſtles in the air, it will not be unſeaſonable to blow down your out-works.</p>
            <p>Sir, the Frontiſpice of your book is worded thus, <hi>The free Grace of God to all the Sons of</hi> Adam <hi>vindicated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 27.22.</note>Sure your voice ſounds like the voice of <hi>Jacob,</hi> but I doubt your hands will prove like the hands of <hi>Eſau;</hi> you give a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious title, which promiſeth much, howſoever you come off in matter of performance look you to that, <hi>Grandia loquuntur inanes,</hi> the emptieſt barrels make the greateſt ſound, <hi>parturiunt montes, naſcitur ridiculus mus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I pray Sir, what mean you by the word <hi>Grace?</hi> If you mean thoſe natural, outward, and common Graces, and ſo I joyn with you that they are Catholick and Univerſal,<note place="margin">Pſ. 145.9. Eccl 9.2. Mat. 5.45. Act. 17.28.</note> for God is good to all, and thoſe outward things come alike to all. He makes the ſame Sun to riſe on the evill and on the good, and ſendeth rain on the juſt and on the unjuſt, for in him we live, and move, and have our being; we ſee many Heathens to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell even Chriſtians themſelves in many morall vertues: Even the wild Barbarians enjoy more plenty of gold, &amp; have a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuller ſoil than the choiceſt Chriſtian; <hi>Cain, Judas, Achitophel, Simon Magus,</hi> or cull out any other of the worſt of Reprobats, and tell me whether he doth not participate in ſome degree and meaſure of Gods free Grace and general love to mankind? All that a man is, hath, or can do proceeding from free Grace and generall love, and then I pray tell me whom have you in this to be your adverſary, you can find none in me.</p>
            <p>But if you intend it of inward, proper, ſpiritual, and ſpecial graces, ſuch as are Redemption, effectual Vocation, Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mens perſons by faith in Chriſt, and Sanctification of their natures by the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, and perſeverance
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65253:15"/>
unto the end, then I affirm that there is no ſuch love of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency in God unto the univerſality of mankind, that any of theſe are communicated but to a peculiar people foreknown according to his eternall purpoſe.</p>
            <p>But what is this to the diſpute before us? The controverſie is about thoſe glorious, eternall, immanent acts of Gods Election and Reprobation, therein diſcriminating the univerſality of the world (as your own poſitions do diſtinguiſh) by parting them into two ranks or ſtations, ſome elected, ſome reprobated. But your title page ſpeaks it, <hi>Gods free Grace to all the Sons of</hi> Adam; I pray Sir the next volume you commit to the Preſs provide your ſelf of a more Homogeneous title which may ſuit more ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quately with the buſineſs in debate.</p>
            <p>Your Title farther brags, <hi>And the Arguments written by Mr</hi> James Rawſon, <hi>a national Miniſter for perſonal election con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Virus creſcit eundo,</hi> what cannot this man do?

            <p>Their reſolves (as you tacitely imply) are not to interpoſe in matters of religion by way of puniſhment.</p>
            <p>But Sir, you are too precipitate in your conjectures, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, and this is grounded on a falſe Hypotheſis, namely that indulgence of Toleration: Wherein if it might be lawfull for me to caſt in my mite, and make a gloſs on ſuch Edicts, I ſhould rather ſay that it is:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Either that thoſe that are approved may be known. Or,</p>

               <note place="margin">Act. 16.3.</note>2. To bear with the infirmity of the weak, as <hi>Paul</hi> cauſed <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> to be circumciſed and not to ſupport the refractory. Or,</p>
            <p n="3">3.

Or,</p>
            <p n="4">
               <note place="margin">Mat. 19.8.</note>4. For the hardneſs of peoples hearts, as <hi>Moſes</hi> permitted a bill of divorce: Or as our Statute Law tolerated uſury, not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of the fact, but diſpenſing with the puniſhment, but <hi>ab initio non-fuit ſic;</hi> rather, I ſay, ſhould I make theſe favourable concluſions then hence to infer, Toleration of Religion is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged to ſome, Therefore the Magiſtrate may not puniſh of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders in the caſe of Religion. And the more eaſily am I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to be of this judgment, becauſe of theſe convincing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the expreſs law of God concerning blaſphemers, <hi>Num.</hi> 24.14.<note place="margin">Num. 14.14. Deut. 13 5. v. 11.17. Deut. 18.20. 1 King 15.12. 2 King. 11.16.</note> and confirmed by a rule for the puniſhment of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtates and inticers to Apoſtacy, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.5, 6. the reaſons whereof are given <hi>v.</hi> 11, 17.

            <p n="2">2. From the examples of Kings and Prophets in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. <hi>Aſa</hi> took away the Sodomits. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 15.12. <hi>Jehojada Athalia.</hi> 2 King. 23.5. <hi>Elijah</hi> the Prophets of <hi>Baal,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.40.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From the examples of the Apoſtles in the new Teſtament, who inflicted puniſhment on ſeverall perſons both for life and limb,<note place="margin">Acts 5.5. Act. 13.11.</note> 
               <hi>Acts</hi> 5.5. At the word of <hi>Peter, Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> were ſtricken dead, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.11. <hi>Elymas</hi> the Sorcerer was ſmitten

with blindneſs at the word of <hi>Paul;</hi> which more remarkable acts of juſtice though they were done by ſpeciall inſtinct, being allien from their calling to inflict corporall puniſhment; yet then how much more ſutable were it for a Chriſtian Magiſtrate to put in practice that authority God hath committed into his hands.</p>
            <p>Neither doth it any whit elude the ſtrength of this Argument to object that the Apoſtles uſed the Word and not the Sword: Becauſe it is thus far ſatisfactory that they inflicted corporall puniſhment on refractory tranſgreſſors.</p>
            <p n="4">4. From the Office of the Magiſtrate, <hi>qui cuſtos eſt utriuſque tabulae,</hi> the ſafeguarder of both the Tables,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> yet in diſtinction from the Church Miniſters, and therefore <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. he is ſaid to be ordained of God for their good not only corporall but ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and hence it is that he ought to vindicate the injuries done by thoſe that profanely hinder the ſpiritual good, and thereby diſturbe the peace and unity of the Church of God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Thefts, Murders, Adulteries, and other like crimes are dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rewarded with poenall and Capitall puniſhments, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much more ought Blaſphemies, Apoſtacies, Perjuries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be puniſhed with ſome ſuch like condign puniſhment, and the rather for that the one are committed immediatly againſt the good of our neighbour only, but the other immediately againſt the honour and glory of God; by the one a loſs is contracted to our bodies or fortunes, but by the other a danger to our ſouls.</p>
            <p n="6">6. From the very light and dictates of nature: The Gentile Governors intereſſed themſelves in matters of Religion, and would never ſuffer their Gods to be blaſphemed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.26.<note place="margin">Ex. 8.29.</note>

            <p n="7">7. Yea, the contrary hereof is obvious to every diſcerning eye, by the late procedure of the highly honourable Court of Parliament againſt that grave Impoſtor and Blaſphemer your brother <hi>Naylor,</hi> wherein notwithſtanding all your intereſts and overbold confidence you are forced to ſit beſides the Cuſhion.</p>

            <p>And thus having left your concealed aſſertion bleeding, I proceed to your reaſons, which are as barren and empty of truth and honeſty, as they are full fraught with malice and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. The firſt tends to this purpoſe, [That the grave Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of this Nation, in whom reſided the Legiſlative power, did heretofore beat down truth inſtead of hereſie, being inſtigated thereunto by our fathers the Biſhops, which crime being eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe now in authority, they have therefore given a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration for any Religion.]</p>

               </label> Well and wiſely ſaid, In anſwer to which let me premiſe this proteſtation from the ſincerity of my heart, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my plain dealing with you in this buſineſs of the Conteſt, yet I bear not the leaſt grudge to your perſon, but ſhould be glad upon any juſt occaſion offered do you the beſt office of love that lies within my compaſs. But yet for all this I cannot without abundance of indignation ſee ſuch a ſhrub, ſuch a worm, ſuch a nothing as you are, to rake up the dead aſhes of thoſe honourable Patriots and venerable Prelates of this then flouriſhing Nation, and ſo to beſpatter them with your ranco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous calumnies.</p>
            <p>What man, were our Nobility and Magiſtracy ſo beſotted that they ſhould be brought into a fooles paradiſe by the delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of others? Did they only ſee with the Biſhops eyes, and were they not quickſighted enough of themſelves to diſcern between good and evill, light and darkneſs, truth and hereſie?</p>
            <p>Fie man, fie, I am aſhamed of your inſolence, this ſure is no better than <hi>Crimen laeſae majeſtatis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the Prelats, who (by a ſimple ſarcaſm) you call your Fathers the Biſhops, cannot you ſee and read as in a lively cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter more piety, zeal, and ſincerity, in the words, and works, and lives of thoſe reverend pillars of the Church, than to ſay, that they were acted by a ſpirit of deluſion? What think you of <hi>Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer, Hooper, Farrar,</hi> &amp;c. who gave up themſelves as a ſacrifice for the teſtimony of the truth, as it is in Jeſus?</p>
            <p>Or what make you of thoſe nearer within our own cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, as of <hi>Jewel, Bilſon, Morton, Uſher, Hall, Davenant,</hi> the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lights of this Nation in their Generation, and the ſplendor
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65253:17"/>
of Europe to all ſucceeding ages? Can your gooſe quill daſh out their luſtre, and make their memorials to rot? No, I cannot endure that ſuch a muſhrome as you are ſhould detract from their learning, piety, and intergrity; for as Learning hath no greater enemy than a Dulman, or an Ignoramus, ſo piety and honeſty find no greater adverſaries than a prophane walker or licentious liver.</p>
            <p>For your ſecond Reaſon, doubtleſs it is the Prerogative Royal of Jeſus Chriſt to rule in the Conſciences of men, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies provided they be conſciences orderly regulated, and that inſtead of Jeſus Chriſt in the conſcience, the ſtrong man armed,<note place="margin">Luk. 11.21. 2 Cor. 11.14.</note> that is, the devill be not there, who often transforming himſelf into an angel of light pleads conſcience, when alas in many it is nothing elſe but wilfulneſs, or affectation of ſingularity, and then he ought to be unrooſted, and the man reduced to conformity, notwithſtanding his plea of conſcience. It is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very pretender to Conſcience that is to be indulged with an immunity from coaction or coercion.</p>
            <p>For ſuppoſe a man irregular in his courſe and converſation, or that in other things he hath a Cheverill conſcience, and can ſwallow down a Camell, ſhall this mans plea of conſcience be accepted in caſe of Religion?</p>
            <p>Or ſuppoſe a man in the opinion that he holds, or practices that he uſeth, making a plea of conſcience for his ſo opining and doing, ſhall yet be imperious, ſcornfull, proud, turbulent, ſelf-conceited, theſe are ſtrong preſumptions of what ſpirit that man is of. No ſuch who have a juſt plea and title to conſcience and priviledges thereof, they are meek, lowly, humble, jealous over their own hearts, thinking others better than themſelves: And that with all he faſts, praies, hears, reads, uſing all poſſible means better to inform him, that ſo if it be poſſible he may keep the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace.</p>
            <p>That Text of Scripture which you bring to evidence what you would have, makes but little for your purpoſe, if without inforcement it may ſpeak the mind of Chriſt, wherein though I might ſay that parabolical argumentations prove no more than for what they were firſt ſpoken: Yet to take our Saviours inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, the tares are children of the wicked one, <hi>i.e.</hi> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill; and then from thence with as much ſtrength of argument we may conclude, that no thief, nor murtherer, nor adulterer,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65253:18"/>
nor any other malefactor is to be puniſhed or removed before the end of the world, any more than he that blaſphemes the name of the high God; give a reaſon againſt it he that can, why a Heretike ſhould receive any more indulgence from that Text than a notorious Malefactor.</p>
            <p>But doubtleſs the ſcope of our Saviour in that parable is, to ſignifie unto us the lot and condition of the Church of God in this life, and that there can be no expectation of an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall purity in this life, but that there will be ſtill tares amongſt the wheat, bad men will be intermingled amongſt the good, neither can they be totally rooted out till the end of the world.</p>
            <p>And as that Text doth not inhibite reproofs from the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry towards evill workers,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> ſo neither doth it reſtrain puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Magiſtrate, for he beareth not the ſword in vain.</p>
            <p>And one thing is remarkable, that Chriſt who forbad the plucking of the tates up, did not yet forbid the Magiſtrate to hinder the ſowing of them, but that in his wiſdome and godly care he may put a reſtraint both upon the Pulpit and Preſs from ſuch incendiaries that promote and propagate ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth doctrines and opinions, without any prejudice to the liberty of conſcience.</p>
            <p>And thus from your Text I come to your Concluſion, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h is, [And therefore they have tolerated all Religions that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>y whoſe principles and actions alſo have been made appear to be againſt the preſent Government.]</p>
            <p>They have, as you ſay, tolerated ſuch Religions, and I wiſh from my ſoul that they may not repent too late of ſuch Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for if we may judge of things by the iſſues and events there were never heard of the like hideous and horrid blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in any age of the world more than ſince Toleration was on foot; They might perhaps whiſper them before, but now they ſpeak them with a full mouth: So that <hi>England</hi> which not long ſince was accounted as an immaculate Virgin, and ſo the glory of the world for ſoundneſs of Doctrine and purity of Converſation, is now lookt upon as a Babell and confuſion of opinions, and the ſink of all Hereſies.</p>
            <p>And one thing I cannot let ſlip without ſome obſervation, that ſuch are concerned in this Toleration who live peaceably
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65253:18"/>
in the Common-wealth and whoſe principles and practices are not inconſiſtent with the preſent Government.</p>
            <p>I am much amazed then how it comes to paſs that your ſect of all others, the Anabaptiſts I mean, ſhould come to have any ſhare in this indulgence, ſince that of all hereſies that ever I have read or heard of, there is not any one that carries ſuch a diametricall oppoſition and direct antipathy againſt the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like peace of a Common-wealth as do the principles and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes of the Anabaptiſts.</p>
            <p>I would not willingly (if I know mine own heart) bear falſe witneſs againſt my neighbour, no, though mine own intereſt were concerned in it, much leſs againſt a ſociety of men, and that eſpecially in the caſe of God.</p>

               </label> Sir, what need was there of multiplying of Controverſies in thruſting theſe in by head and ſhoulders; I am ſure you have more upon your hands already than your Infancy is able to weild: And for thoſe two ſubjects offered to conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> Univerſall Redemption, and Baptiſm of Infants, there is as much ſaid in them already by divers learned men of our ſide, and particularly by Dr <hi>Kendal</hi> againſt <hi>Goodwin,</hi> and Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> againſt <hi>Tombes,</hi> to the ſatisfaction of any reaſonable men that are not blinded through prejudice, and even to the ſilencing of their very adverſaries, that it would be but caſting water into the ſea for me to caſt in my mite. Yet becauſe that every man hath not the opportunity to read their works, and that you may not have cauſe of glorying if I ſhould ſlide over this, I ſhall undertake, through the guidance of Gods ſpirit, to give in the genuine ſence and ſcope of thoſe Texts of Scripture nakedly muſtred up by you in favour of your Univerſall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and thus you begin:</p>
            <p>[The former is witneſſed by <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.4, 5, 6. where it plainly appeareth, that the iniquity of all that went aſtray are laid on him, that is, on Jeſus Chriſt. Likewiſe by <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 145.8, 9. <hi>The Lord is gracious and full of compaſſion, ſlow to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and of great mercy. The Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works.</hi> Yea, Chriſt himſelf witneſſeth to this truth in <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16, 17. And by his Apoſtles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. And the Angel of the Lord alſo, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.10, 11. And for the later, which is the baptizing ſuch in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, who confeſſeth faith in him, it is ſo highly promoted by Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, that there is neither precept nor preſident for the ſprinkling or waſhing of Infants in his name.]</p>

            <p>And firſt, whereas you ſay, that it plainly appears that the iniquity of all that went aſtray were laid on Chriſt is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly falſe, and to make my charge good, as the Eunuch asked <hi>Philip, Acts</hi> 8.34. Of whom ſpeaks the Prophet this?<note place="margin">Act. 8.34.</note> You, I imagine, by the help of the Particle All, will extend the ſcope of this Chapter to all men of all ſorts: But I ſay, and that with better reaſon, that the word <hi>Us</hi> reſtrains the univerſall Particle to a definite number. And therefore take this rule from me for your better underſtanding, in giving or taking the ſence of a Scripture: That when the Prophets, Apoſtles, and holy men of God ſpeak to others, including themſelves (as by way of priviledge, and partaking of the benefit of a promiſe) by theſe terms of <hi>Us, Our,</hi> or <hi>Me,</hi> they commonly and conſtantly underſtand perſons under the ſame conſideration and capacity people under one relation and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification, ſuch who are nearly related, as fighting under one Captain, ſheep fed under one ſhepherd,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.14. 1 Cor. 12.13.</note> knit together by one bond of the ſpirit, joyned together in one Communion of Saints; for what fellowſhip hath righteouſneſs with unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By one ſpirit baptized into one body, having one Lord one Faith, one Baptiſm <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>And thus this our Prophet, an elect perſon, a beleever ſpeaks all this Chapter over of himſelf with other Elect and beleeving perſons. And leſt you ſhould ſay, it is true that beleevers are included, and yet are not unbeleevers excluded; I ſhall prove, and that only out of this Chapter that hereby is meant all beleevers and only beleevers, or at leaſt thoſe that have, did, or ſhall beleeve.</p>

            <p>So that it is undoubtedly true, that not only this Text, but this whole Chapter makes moſt mainly for me againſt your ſelf.</p>

               </label> That by All men unto whom did ſlow the benefit purchaſed by Chriſt is not meant of all and ſingular men abſolutely, but all men that did appertain unto him, who were given him of the Father, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the elect and believers. For the Apoſtle here makes a compariſon between the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> and the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> as being two roots either of whom do communicate unto their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral branches, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> unto a certain company deſcending from them what they have, do, or ſhall enjoy, and therefore ſaith, that as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> by his carnal generation did communicate two peſtilent evils, Sin and Death, unto all deſcending from him: So Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> by his ſpiritual generation did commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate two contrary bleſſings, <hi>viz.</hi> Righteouſneſs and Life, to all that did believe in him. The truth of this interpretation is clear from the ſcope of the Apoſtle, which is to compare Chriſt the Authour of Righteouſneſs and Life, with <hi>Adam</hi> the Authour of Sin and Death, from <hi>ver.</hi> 12. to the end of the Chapter, and therefore hereupon, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. repeating the ſame matter, (which in probability ſhould be more clear) the word all is interpreted by many.</p>
            <p>For had it been otherwiſe, the Apoſtle would have pulled down what before he had built up, and clearly contradicted himſelf in that doctrine which he had before delivered in the third and fourth Chapters, therein aſſerting the juſtification onely of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and therefore here is but little advantage to be gotten from this Antitheſis.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, if more periſhed in <hi>Adam</hi> then are ſaved in Chriſt, his Grace then ſhould be weaker then <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, where is then the much more abounding grace ſpoken of <hi>ver.</hi> 17.?</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, that the greatneſs and power of grace above <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, ought not to be eſteemed according to the multitude of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65253:24"/>
thoſe that are condemned in <hi>Adam,</hi> and of thoſe that are juſtified and glorified in Chriſt, for ſo Grace ſhould be equal onely, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all ſtronger then ſin, if every of theſe ſhould be made righteous in Chriſt, as many as were born ſinners in <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But herein conſiſts the extenſiveneſs of Grace, beyond what ſin did, Firſt in that whereas ſin brought forth death, and grace righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and life, now its well known tis eaſier to deſtroy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn an innumerable company then to quicken and ſave one ſingle perſon; all the world compacted together could not ſave one, but <hi>Adams</hi> ſingle ſin could make obnoxious the whole world.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In <hi>Adam</hi> all the whole world are involved and made liable to condemnation, by his one only offence, but Chriſt doth emancipate his little flock, not onely from that one original ſin contracted by ſtain and imputation, but likewiſe from all actual ſins, wherein they themſelves are perſonally culpable, neither is there any Righteouſneſs beſides Chriſt, as there be ſome ſins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> And how mighty is this gift which innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable ſinners cannot withſtand? and this is that which the Apoſtle hinteth <hi>ver.</hi> 17. and not as &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And ſo I proceed to your fifth Text preſt to give in evidence, which is, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15. <hi>For the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: and that he died for all, that they which live, ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him which dyed for them, and roſe again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>True it is Chriſt is ſaid here that he died for all, but for what all, therein lies the doubt, truly then the reſolve muſt be that Chriſt died, firſt for thoſe all, to whom his death is imputed, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch who through the virtue and efficacy of the death of Chriſt, which he underwent for them are accounted as dead, and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.14.</note> for ſuch as do repent <hi>(i. e.)</hi> whereas before they did indulge their pleaſures, and lived to the ſatisfying of the fleſh to fulfill the luſts thereof, now they live no longer to themſelves, but do endeavour to live conformably to the will and honour of him that died for them. Now whether this can be extended to any but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers let my adverſary judge, for it were blaſphemy to think that Chriſt could not obtain the end of his death, had it been intended by him for any elſe beſides believers, yea even thoſe to whom he had purpoſed to give them power to believe and to become ſons of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:65253:24"/>The ſixth Text forced by you to give its vote is, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. <hi>&amp;c. I exhort therefore that firſt of all, ſupplications, prayers, interceſſions, and giving of thanks be made for all men, for Kings and for all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty, for this is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour, who will have all men to be ſaved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth: for there is one God, and one mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and man, the man Ieſus Chriſt, who gave himſelf a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for all to be teſtified in due time, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In anſwer to which it wil be expedient for me to make ſome Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſis on this part of the chapter, according to the mind and ſcope of the Holy Ghoſt: In the former chapter the Apoſtle had been treating of matter of Doctrine to be propoſed to the Church: and now begins with the treatiſe of publick prayer, and firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth the queſtion, for whom they ought to pray, he aſſerts that they ought to pray for all, and namely for Kings, and thoſe magiſtrates that were in Authority: Now becauſe it might be doubted, and perhaps was not practiſed, to pray for ſuch by reaſon that for the moſt part the magiſtrates were heatheniſh, and ſo wicked in their lives and perſecutors of the Church, he reſolves that for ſuch they ought to pray, and this he confirms by ſeveral arguments. The firſt is drawn from the advantage that might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue thereof, for if by and through (as it might be poſſible) their prayers, the hearts of thoſe Magiſtrates were turned to a liking of Chriſtianity, they might thereby <hi>lead a godly and peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ſecond Argument is drawn from the comfort that would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue to themſelves <hi>ver.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">Matth. 5.44. 1 Pet. 4.19.</note> 
               <hi>For this is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour: that men pray for them that perſecute them and deſpightfully uſe them, committing the keeping of their ſouls to him in well doing, as to a faithful Creator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Argument he confirms from the end propoſed, for he that wills the end wills likewiſe the means conducing to the end. But it is the good will and pleaſure of God that all ſorts of men ſhould be ſaved, and therefore his will is that ſome of Kings and others in Authority ſhould be ſaved, as well as others and upon that account prayers to be made for them, that they may come to the knowledge of the truth and ſo be ſaved, <hi>ver.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>Now that God would have all men <hi>(i. e.)</hi> men of all ſorts ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, this he confirms by a double reaſon, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:65253:25"/>The firſt is, becauſe God is one, even the God of all men <hi>(i. e.)</hi> becauſe God in every ſort and condition of men hath his elect ones whom he tenderly loves. Secondly, becauſe God is one Mediator of God and man who gave himſelf a ranſome for all, <hi>viz.</hi> for all ſorts of men, high and low, rich and poor, one with another, where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumciſion nor uncircumciſion, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free, but Chriſt is all, and in all. For certain it is, that for thoſe alone Chriſt offered himſelf unto the Father, for whom he prayed unto the Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he prayed onely for thoſe who were given to him of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>(i.e.)</hi> onely for the elect and not for the world <hi>(i.e.)</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.9.</p>
            <p>Another Argument is uſed by the Apoſtle, <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7. From the Ordinance of Chriſt in the preaching of the Goſpel; for tis the good pleaſure of God that this ſhould be as an inſtrument by which he would exert his own power in creating and infuſing faith into ſuch whom he purpoſed to ſave.</p>
            <p>When therefore this preaching is deſigned for the Gentiles likewiſe, and that <hi>Paul</hi> received a Commiſſion for the Preaching of it to the Gentiles, it followes therefore that there were elect ones among the Gentiles who were to be converted to the faith that they might be ſaved; and upon this occaſion doth he aſſert his Apoſtleſhip, and confirms it with an oath.</p>
            <p>So that to conclude this point, it is Gods will that ſome of all ſorts of men ſhould be ſaved, becauſe all ſorts of men are to be prayed for. But we are not to pray for all and ſingular men of all ſorts, for there are ſome that 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.16. we are commanded not to pray for, and <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.9. Chriſt excludes ſome out of his prayers, and therefore it is not his will that all men of all ſorts ſhould be ſaved.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The whole context doth evince that the extent thereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns onely all the elect or all believers, for who are theſe all or every man but who <hi>ver.</hi> 10. he calleth ſons brought unto glory, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. perſons ſanctified, <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12. brethren of Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 13.

            <p>Your next encounter is, with what ſtrength you can ſqueeze out of 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. wherein I believe you would inſiſt upon the laſt words, <hi>not willing that any one ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if you would light the candle at the former part of the verſe, that will diſcover who thoſe all are, <hi>viz.</hi> the elect and believers. The Lord, ſaith the Apoſtle, is long-ſuffering to us ward <hi>(i. e.)</hi> us whom he hath called by the Goſpel, <hi>and now doth call, not willing that any, viz. of us ſhould periſh,</hi> but that all, viz. <hi>of us come to repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for this cauſe he defers his coming to judgment, at which profane ſcoffers ſay, Where is the promiſe of his coming? He defers it not for the ſake of the Reprobates for he will come too ſoon for them, defer the Lord ſo long as he pleaſe: But he defers it for the ſake of the elect, that they all may be gathered into a fulneſs of one body unto the unity of the faith, not willing that any of thoſe elect ſhould periſh or be uncalled, but that all of theſe elect ſhould come to repentance and to be ſaved by ſuch means as were fore-appointed.</p>
            <p>That which brings up the rear of all your great atchievement, is <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.10, 11, <hi>&amp;c. I bring you good tidings of great joy which ſhall be to all people, for unto you is given this day in the city of David a Saviour which is Chriſt the Lord.</hi>

No Sir, we have a greater and yet war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable latitude in our probates of divine Injunctions, that if a thing can be proved by a neceſſary and undeniable conſequence, it will equipend with either precept or preſident: I could give In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.16.</note> but that is bootleſs at this time, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.16. <hi>We have no ſuch cuſtome neither the Churches of Chriſt,</hi> is a good Argument with the Apoſtle negatively. We have ſuch a cuſtome, and ſo have the Churches of Chriſt is as good an argument with us af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatively, yea even now ſince the times of the Apoſtle.</p>
            <p>But leſt that you ſhould take this rather as a tergiverſation than an anſwer, I will apply my ſelf more particularly to ſay ſome what as to ſatisfaction. And</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there is, a command extant <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.29. Of Baptizing all the members of the Church, whereof children are a part, the promiſes appertaining to them as well as to thoſe of years.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Acts 2.39.</note>If you look for a ſpecial command and ſhall deny that Infants are comprehended under that general command, becauſe they cannot be taught, I muſt tell you, that whoſoever propoſeth a thing in general terms, he doth thereby comprehend all ſpecials, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he make a particular exception: and whatſoever is, and hath been of a perpetuated and continued right and uſe in the Church of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65253:26"/>
Chriſt once eſtabliſhed <hi>viz.</hi> that the covenant of God ſhould be ſealed upon the covenanters, there will be no need of any repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of any ſort or condition of perſons who they are or ſhould be that are intended to be thoſe covenanters: And yet truly Sir in my judgement, if you were well put to it, you would find more difficulty in your baptizing of Infants.</p>
            <p>And for the qualification you require of theſe which are to be Baptized, that is appliable to the primitive Church which was gathered of perſons of ripe years, and as in reference to ſuch they were firſt to be taught before Baptized: But for Infants who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the condition of their parents, the promiſes appertaining to the parents being entayled to the children another courſe is had.</p>
            <p>And as to matter of preſident, we have examples for the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of whole families, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.45, 33. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.16. out of which Infants cannot be excluded: ſhew me elſe when and where and upon what grounds that priviledge that Infants formerly had was reverſed and repealed, and then you will ſay ſomewhat.</p>
            <p>And yet if this will not ſatisfie, I will put you one argument to boot.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> To whomſoever God is pleaſed to be a God in covenant, and to make a covenant-promiſe, thoſe are to be Baptized by the command of Chriſt: But to the Infants of thoſe which are in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, God hath been pleaſed to expreſs himſelf to be in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and to make covenant-promiſes unto them: Therefore ſuch Infants are to be Baptized by the command of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Both the propoſitions are confirmed out of <hi>Acts</hi> 2. The Major from <hi>ver.</hi> 38. and 39. compared together. <hi>Repent and be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized every one of you in the name of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> for the promiſe is made to you and to your children. The minor propoſition is likewiſe proved from <hi>ver.</hi> 39. for the promiſe is made to your children. But becauſe that the ſtrength of the Argument may more evidently appear, I will annex ſomewhat for Illuſtration of the text.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is ſet down the command of being baptized, <hi>Be Baptized every one of you:</hi> 2. There is added a reaſon of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand [for] which is not to be reſtrained to the laſt words in the former verſe of receiving the gifts of the holy Ghoſt promiſed in <hi>Ioel,</hi> but of all other gracious bleſſings of the Covenant, which will appear by comparing of thoſe places, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.25. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.33. 3. There is the ſubject, receiving the promiſe, which
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65253:27"/>
is amplified by a diſtribution, where to the parents are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned children, indefinitely without any manner of difference either of ſex or age.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Both of them <hi>viz.</hi> Parents and Children their receiving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Covenant of Grace, is moſt clearly to be gathered from the firſt Covenant entred into with <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, whether of Jews or Gentiles, ratified from <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.10, 11. Where the Infants are accounted in the ſame condition with the Parents, and the males were circumciſed the eighth day, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10, 11. And therefore likewiſe in the New Teſtament the Infants of Chriſtians are to be eſteemed in the condition of their Chriſtian Parents: they are ſanctified in them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. and therefore with them are to be baptized.</p>
            <p>More I have written on this ſubject, and committed it to ſome of your friends to reading, which if you deſire to peruſe, no queſtion you may have the view of it, but in the mean time do you chew the cud upon this.</p>
            <p>Having done with theſe impertinencies to the buſineſs in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt between us, you proceed to Revolters, of whom you wrote thus. [But that ſome who have been profeſſors of the truth have withdrawn themſelves from the ſame it is evident, and proved Traytors thereunto, as did <hi>Iudas</hi> for love of mony, and as <hi>Demas,</hi> to imbrace this preſent world; yea, ſome have been ſo far cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with covetous practiſes in theſe our dayes, that they have forſaken the right way, and are gone aſtray, following the way of <hi>Baalam</hi> the ſon of <hi>Boſar,</hi> who loved the wages of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for ſome have withdrawn themſelves from the truth, that they might be partakers with you in their tithes and offerings, and ſome alſo have been led away by the temptations of Satan, and good is the word of the Lord which hath ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.30. that of your own ſelves ſhall men ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe things to draw away diſciples after them.</p>
            <p>But it may be as truly ſaid, that Jeſus is not the Chriſt, becauſe one of his miniſters left him and betrayed him, as it can be ſaid that this is not the way of Chriſt, becauſe ſome turn from it, and prove traytors thereunto.]</p>

            <p>For though by other ſeveral Chronographers the groſſeneſs of his hereſie be more copiouſly painted out, yet in the tripartite Hiſtory according to you cited, there is to be found ſo much as to abominate even the name of the man, by reaſon of his curſed opinion, being there ranked out in the columne of Hereticks; and therefore it ſeems a wonder to me, that any one that is but a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender to Religion, ſhould have ſo much impudence, and be ſo Galliolized,<note place="margin">Act. 18.17</note> as not to care for theſe things.

The argument whereby he preſſeth it, is from the diverſe end and iſſue of thoſe who are ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with, and thoſe who want thoſe graces, which are expreſt in theſe three laſt verſes by you cited: But what is this, likewiſe, to election or Reprobation? which are eternal acts before all time, and theſe are tranſient acts being wrought in time.</p>
            <p>For that of <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved, but he that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do readily acknowledge it a point declaratory of the Goſpel, for the way and means that God himſelf hath deſigned for the ſaving of ſouls; but mark the manner of the diſcovery; it ſaith, <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved,</hi> but it ſaith not, he that believeth ſhall be elected, which is the buſineſs you are about.</p>
            <p>It ſhewes that faith or believing is an ingredient, and enters into the decree of the means conducing to the end, which is ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but it is not the decree it ſelf of election, which all along you ſhamefully confound; jumbling together the decree and the means, ſo that for want either of wit or will, you do not at all diſtinguiſh, between the Decree of election it ſelf, of ſaving a certain company, which is the end, and the decree of the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

of the means tending to that end.</p>
            <p>And thus any one may ſee what a fair copy you have drawn of Gods decree of Election and Reprobation, by ſuch impertinent proofs, which give no light at all to the point controverted.</p>
            <p>Which doth much amaze me, that a man that arrogates to himſelf to be a teacher of a ſelected company, that ſhall make his brags (as I have heard you have done) that with his own hands he hath dipt ſo many, ſhould yet feed his over-credulous auditors with ſuch extravagancies as theſe are.</p>
            <p>Truly Sir, if your luck be not better in your popular teachings then you are in this, you will neither reap credit, nor the people profit.</p>
            <p>And unleſs you can bring more appoſite texts of Scripture to prove your Doctrinals, then you do here for the proof of your Polemicals, you will make but blew work of it.</p>
            <p>And whereas you ſay, [ſhew us a true copy of it if you can] Sir, for the ſatisfying you in this, and that my procedure may be the more regular in what ſhal follow, I conceive it will be no digreſſion to give you a preliminary, in brief Characters, of the Decrees of God, of Preſcience, of Predeſtination, of Election, and Reprobation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The decree of God, is an action of God out of the counſell and purpoſe of his own will, determining all things, and all the circumſtances, and order of all things from eternity, in himſelf; certainly and unchangeably, and yet freely, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.23. and 4.28. and 11.18.</p>
            <p>For whatſoever either the creature doth, or God about the creature, that from eternity was decreed, that it ſhould be ſo done.</p>
            <p>This decree of God, we find it under ſeveral appellations in the Scripture, ſometimes ſtyled the <hi>Counſel of God, Acts</hi> 4.28. ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>the determinate Counſel, Acts</hi> 2.23. ſometimes <hi>Good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, Epheſ.</hi> 1.9. ſometimes <hi>Good pleaſure of his will, Epheſ.</hi> 1.5. ſometimes <hi>the counſel of his will, Epheſ.</hi> 1.11. ſometimes <hi>the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God, Rom.</hi> 9.11. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. ſometimes <hi>foreknowledge of God, Rom.</hi> 8.29. and 11.2. ſometimes <hi>the will of God, Rom.</hi> 9.18.</p>
            <p>Wherein yet we uſe that one and accuſtomed word of Decree, to help our weak capacities, as being the Judgement, Counſel and Will of God, which is indeed God himſelf willing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing.</p>
            <p>Not that we do conceive any ratiocination, deliberation and collection from premiſes to concluſion, proceeding from one
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65253:32"/>
thing to another, which are uſually incident to antecede the edicts and decrees of men; no, we dare not reduce God to ſuch ſtraits, for what God herein doth, it is by one ſingle ſimple and eternal act of the will determining and decreeing what him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf will do or permit to be done.</p>
            <p>And for thoſe decrees of God, ſuch is the freedom and liberty of that will of his (which is himſelf willing) that there can be aſſigned no cauſe at all, either efficient, meritorious, or final, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out himſelf, he being the <hi>primum movens,</hi> which moveth all things, and is moved of none.</p>
            <p>But if we have a reſpect to the effects of thoſe Decrees in the creature, and ſo there may be aſſigned cauſes both efficient, meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious and final: for ſo hath God decreed to confer ſalvation and glory on the elect by, for, and through the merit of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo likewiſe eternally to puniſh the reprobate for their ſin, both of theſe to be manifeſted to the praiſe of his free grace and juſtice.</p>
            <p>Having ſpoken thus of the decrees in general, I proceed next to the foreknowledge of God as the effect following its cauſe.</p>
            <p>I mean not that which is indefinitely called in the Schools <hi>ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicis intelligentiae,</hi> which is the eſſential knowledge of God, and which is extended to all things knowable, both poſſible and impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; but that which is definite and intuitive, called <hi>Scientia vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionis,</hi> and that is;</p>
            <p>A certain and infallible knowledge of things which are to come to paſs: of this you may ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 15.18. <hi>Iob</hi> 28.24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.2, 12. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19.</p>
            <p>For whereas no forgetfulneſs can befall the Deity which by his decree he hath determined: ſo is his foreknowledge certain.</p>
            <p>Yet this foreknowledge is ſo to be underſtood, not that it is dependent on the things that are to come to paſs, but meerly on the decree of God determining of the futurity of things, and this is called practical foreknowledge.</p>
            <p>But whereas all the decrees of God are as himſelf, Immutable, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.23. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.29. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.11. <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.24, 27. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17. as being acted by him that is moſt wiſe and Almighty, and that this foreknowledge reſting on this immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table decree is infallible: Hence doth ariſe a double neceſſity of the futurition of things, but both Hypothetical and conditional; the one is a neceſſity of Immutability, as in reference to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65253:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the other a neceſſity of infallibility, as in reference to the foreknowledge: this is clearly gathered out of <hi>Luke</hi> 24.26, 27, 44, 46. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.15.</p>
            <p>But this they have in reſpect of the firſt agent; but in themſelves, and as by reaſon of ſecundary agents or cauſes they may ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue contingent and free.</p>
            <p>The third in order is Predeſtination, which I define to be an eternal, immutable, moſt wiſe and efficacious decree wherein God according to his meer good pleaſure, out of the whole lump of mankind, fallen and loſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> hath decreed to ſave ſome by Jeſus Chriſt the mediator, to the praiſe of his moſt glorious Grace, and the reſt to leave in that miſerable ſtate, and at the laſt for their ſins to reward them with eternal puniſhment for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of his liberty and juſtice.</p>
            <p>That this is dependent on the meer good pleaſure of God, ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.26. <hi>Even ſo Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight. Luke</hi> 12.32. <hi>It is your fathers good pleaſure to give you a kingdom.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.9. the Apoſtle there comprehends both Election and Reprobation in a few words: <hi>He hath not appointed us unto wrath, but to obtain ſalvation by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which ſhall tend to the glory of God, for to that end was man created, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.4. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.15.</p>
            <p>And therefore neither have the elect cauſe for which they ſhould boaſt, becauſe what they do receive is of undeſerved grace;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.7.</note> neither are thoſe who are pretermitted cauſe to complain, whiles they have but their deſerved reward,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> the Potter having power over his lump of clay, <hi>to make one veſſel to honour another to diſhonour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which hath the fourth place is Election, which is not to be underſtood of an election to a civil or ſacred place or office, as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.24. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.70. Nor of a people ſeparated to a ſpecial Covenant, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.37. Nor onely of ſuch as were called to the outward profeſſion of the Goſpel, whereof a Church may conſiſt, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27. But it is,</p>
            <p>A perſonal, definite and immutable ſeparation of certain ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men, from the reſt of mankind, and preordaining them to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, by ſuch means as it hath pleaſed him to appoint in his moſt wiſe decre, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.16. and 24.24. <hi>Mar.</hi> 13.20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7.</p>
            <p>And means for the execution of this decree of election are
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65253:33"/>
Redemption by Jeſus Chriſt, effectual vocation, juſtification by faith, and ſanctification joyned with perſeverance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29, 30. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.9. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.48. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6.</p>
            <p>In election Chriſt is the baſis and head thereof, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4, 5. both in that he was deſigned by the Father as a Redeemer of the elect, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 12.2. As alſo becauſe that ſuch ſo elected were given to Chriſt to be redeemed by him and to be brought unto glory. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.6. and 10.16. So that Chriſt is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled in the decree of election, not as a meritorious cauſe of it, nor as the foundation thereof, but as executing that decree, and the meritorious cauſe of grace and glory to be conferred upon the elect according to the decree of God.</p>
            <p>Faith likewiſe, ſanctification, good works and perſeverance, are ingredients in the decree conſequently, as means ordained to the end by that decree, but not antecedently, as the foundation or cauſes upon foreſight whereof our election doth depend.</p>
            <p>For if upon the foreſight of our faith, or foreſeeing who would believe, or embracing of the means, or continuance therein, our election ſhould depend, then were it neceſſary that the ſame ſhould be foreſeen in us, either as thoſe graces or works, wrought in us by our ſelves, and of our own innate ſtrength, or elſe wrought in us onely by God, and of his grace and gift alone: If youl' ſay they proceed as from our ſelves, as from the innate activity and choice of our own free-will, then have we whereof to boaſt, and then have we made our ſelves to differ from others, contrary to that of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. for what maketh thee to differ from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and what haſt thou that thou didſt not receive? now if thou didſt receive it, what doſt thou glory is if thou hadſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it? But if we have received that grace from God, and that it be onely of his working in us to give us faith and repentance from dead works, &amp;c. Then God hath decreed to give us thoſe graces, which ſince they are infallible means unto ſalvation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are to be drawn and derived from infallible election, wherin ſalvation is decreed unto us; for the further clearing wherof conſult theſe places, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.25, 26. <hi>Luke.</hi> 12.32. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11, 12. and 11.5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.25. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.37. and 8.47. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.24. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.19.</p>
            <p>The laſt propoſed is Reprobation, which is the eternal, Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and moſt free decree of God, wherein a certain company
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65253:33"/>
of men, conſidered in an alike lump and maſs of corruption and guilt with all others, he hath decreed to paſs them by and not to have mercy upon them, neither to confer on them the means tending to ſalvation, but leaving them in their ſin whereinto they had caſt themſelves, for the ſame ſin to condemn them, for the manifeſtation of his liberty, and juſtice, and power.</p>
            <p>This reprobation (by a metonymy) is ſtyled in Scripture Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.13. <hi>So the purpoſe of God, Rom.</hi> 9.11, <hi>that determined counſel of God, Acts</hi> 2.23. <hi>the good pleaſure of God, Mat.</hi> 12.25, 26. <hi>And the Reprobates are called veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction. Rom.</hi> 9.22. <hi>men of old ordained to condemnation, diſobedient, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they were appointed,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Appointed unto wrath,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.9. <hi>wicked made for the day of evil, Pro.</hi> 16.4.</p>
            <p>All which do argue, that God is the efficient cauſe of Reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that hell fire is prepared for ſuch Goats as well as for the Devil and his Angels, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41. that God muſt be the efficient cauſe of Reprobation, as well as of election, appears in this, that as he elects <hi>(i. e.)</hi> decrees to ſave ſome, ſo likewiſe he decrees to Reprobate <hi>(i. e.)</hi> to paſs by and leave others, and not elect them, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.40, 41. For elſe had not he fore-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined what to do with a great part of mankind, but to have left them to an uncertain event, which is unſuitable to his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>Now the act of God in Reprobating may be diſtinguiſhed into a negative and privative act <hi>(i.e.)</hi> of not granting ſalvation, nor conferring means of ſalvation; and into an affirmative or poſitive act <hi>(i. e.)</hi> of inflicting damnation, and of blinding and hardening.</p>
            <p>After both theſe waies the Scripture ſets forth Reprobation.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Negatively, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.23. and 25.12. <hi>I know you not. Ioh.</hi> 10.26. <hi>you are not of my ſheep. Ioh.</hi> 17.19. <hi>I pray not for the world. Matth.</hi> 13.11. <hi>to them it is not given to know the myſteries of the kingdome of heaven:</hi> 2 Affirmatively, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.13. <hi>Eſau have I hated, Rom.</hi> 9.22. <hi>veſſels of wrath ſitted to deſtruction. Rom.</hi> 9.18. <hi>whom he will he hardens. Ioh.</hi> 12.39, 40. <hi>They could not believe, becauſe he had blinded their eyes, and hardened their hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that if it be demanded wherefore God when he ſaw all men in an alike condition, ſinners and children of wrath, Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated ſome <hi>(i. e.)</hi> did not elect them, or ſuffered not his face to ſhine on them, as he did on others, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe which he did elect, no reaſon can be aſſigned for this, but the abſolute good pleaſure of his will.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:65253:34"/>But if it be demanded, why he doth not confer ſalvation on them, or glorifie their perſons in heaven, but contrarily inflicts upon them eternal torments in hell, here the cauſe is aſſigned to be their own ſinnes. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41, 42. <hi>Go ye curſed into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire, for I was hungry, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>the wages of ſin is death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore in the matter of Reprobation God is to be lookt upon partly as a ſovereign, who hath the ſole power and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over his creature,<note place="margin">Pſal. 145.17. Gen. 18.25.</note> and partly as a Judge, who is righteous in all his waies and doth right to every man: As a ſovereigne, and ſo according to his abſolute power and liberty, dependent on his own will and accountable to none, it is lawful for him to do what he will with his own, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>And thus having drawn you a fair copy of election and Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination, I am now at leiſure to ſee what you will ſay to my firſt Argument, which in forme is this.</p>
            <p>If the riſe of our election be ſounded on the meer mercy and free grace of God, then it is not upon Gods foreſight of mans embracing the means of ſalvation.</p>
            <p>But it is founded in the meer mercy and free grace of God, therefore not upon the foreſight of the embracing the means.</p>
            <p>To which you frame this anſwer.</p>
            <p>The firſt propoſition or Major he ſaith is unqueſtionable, and that is all the proof that we have from him for it, ſaying, there is but one cauſe to produce the effect. The Minor he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Scripture for the proof of it, the truth of which I do not queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the Scriptures are, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.7, 8. and 10.15. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.15. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.32. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11, 18, 21. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5, 11. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9.</p>
            <p>The Minor it appears you give fair quarter to, and let it paſs upon its paroll. Tis the major you quarrel at, as having nothing to ſecond it but this, ſaying that there is but one cauſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the effect; and truly Sir, I believe that might have been unqueſtionable to any but you and your comrades, who do <hi>nodum in ſcirpo quaerere.</hi> I had thought it might have paſt for unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble divinity, that God is ſo jealous a God that he will not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate his glory to any other, and that if any act of Grace paſs ſingly and ſolely from himſelf, that then no other creature could have been a copartner with him, and that if of grace, then not of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65253:34"/>
works, (which is nothing elſe but the embracing of the means.) And to that foundation (which was laid before all time) <hi>other foundation can no man lay,</hi> then that is laid, eſpecially in time. And that, as to the foreknowledge of God or his foreſight, God doth not foreſee any thing which he hath not decreed either effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caciouſly to do, or permit to be done. So that his foreknowledge ſhould reſt upon the decree, and at no hand to depend on the things to be done, but that all things depend upon that, and that God did ſee nothing in their cauſes, which he did not before ſee in his decree, theſe I thought had been unqueſtionable truths, till <hi>Thomas Faſwel</hi> calls them into queſtion, pretending that though grace may be of free and meer mercy, yet there may be a concurrence of mans actings in the embracing of the means.</p>
            <p>And whence doth all this ariſe but from an embaſing of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God, by meaſuring his corn by your buſhel,<note place="margin">Iſa. 55.8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>making his waies like our waies, and his thoughts like our thoughts?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No Sir, I would have you go to ſchool and learn the vaſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between humane and divine knowledge; humane know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge doth depend upon the exiſtence of things, and things are the meaſure thereof; but for divine knowledge, that is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of things, and things depend upon that, not that on them.</p>
            <p>And certainly unleſs this be granted, the foundation of divine providence muſt needs come to wrack, God could not hold his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative royal of being the firſt cauſe of all things; yea ſecond cauſes would be made independent in many acts, yea conſequently in all: for how the ſecond cauſe could work, or be appointed to work without the concourſe of the firſt cauſe, it looks like <hi>contradictio in objecto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or how elſe could God certainly foreſee ſuch things to come to paſs, which are ſuppoſed onely to be foreſeen, and not withal to be provided for and preordained? For as the things are, ſo is the knowledge of the things, and that which hath not certain cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of futurition, cannot certainly be foreknown; for certainly to foreknow what is not certainly to come to paſs, is to have a knowledge of a thing, not as what it is, but as what it is not, and what will then become of Gods foreknowledge?</p>
            <p>But whereto tends the deſigne of the adverſary? ſurely that an in let may be made, and beds of roſes troden out, to introduce that great <hi>Diana,</hi> the liberty of the will, to chooſe or refuſe what ſhall

            <p>But notwithſtanding he ſetteth ſuch a ſtrong guard upon his Major, ſaying it is unqueſtionable, yet I muſt needs queſtion the the mans meaning in the ſequel or conſequence of it, Then it is not upon Gods foreſight of mans embracing the means of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.]</p>

               </label> Here I will intreat the intelligent Reader conſiderately to take notice, how this merchant of rags endeavours to juggle with me, and by acting the Gypſies part, to play faſt and looſe with my firſt Argument; for howſoever it is by me affirmed, that Gods electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is abſolute in it ſelf, irreſpectrive and irrelative, as to the end, <hi>viz.</hi> ſalvation, to which there was no motive or incentive, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of faith foreſeen, or embracing of the means, or continuing therein, or any thing elſe; yet withal (as before hinted) I do maintain that the ſame God that determined of the end, did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe decree unto ſuch perſons ſo elected fit and ſuitable means conducing to that end, <hi>viz.</hi> that he would ſend his Son to become a propitiation for them, that he would effectually call them by his Goſpel, that he would give them faith to anſwer that call by believing, that he would juſtifie their perſons and ſanctifie their natures, and keep them by his power through faith unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               </label> Here is his warping, for ſee how he fumbles together the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree it ſelf of ſalvation, with the means for the execution of that decree, no waies diſtinguiſhing but confounding election with juſtification and embracing of the means.</p>
            <p>It is very true, and it is a Goſpel-declaration, that God will ſave all thoſe that he doth juſtifie, <hi>and who do embrace the means in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and truth, Rom.</hi> 8.29. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.24. But if he prove out of any part of the Bible from <hi>Geneſis</hi> to the <hi>Revelation,</hi> that God will elect all thoſe that do or ſhall embrace the means of ſalvation, I will give him the cauſe, and cry <hi>peccavi:</hi> and it is to be marked, that we are about the point of election, and not of juſtification, and therefore all ſuch proofs that ſpeak onely of juſtification, and not ſpecifically of election, are alien to the point.</p>
            <p>For all the reſt of his words, if the grant may gratify him, I will freely give him, <hi>viz.</hi> that all ſorts of people that do embrace the means, to wit, the free tenders of grace in the Goſpel, ſhall undoubtedly be ſaved. But whats this to the Argument of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection?</p>
            <p>You further add [But if by theſe words, Then it is not upon Gods foreſight of mens embracing the means, but onely that the embracing of the means is not a motive or mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſe for which God elects, then his Argument is true in every part of it; but I have ſome cauſe to except againſt the ſequel of his major propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> then it is not upon Gods foreſight of mens embracing the means; not ſo much in reſpect of any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth I find in it, if his meaning be as aforeſaid, but the exception that I make againſt it, is in reſpect of the terms of it, becauſe it varieth from the poſition, not anſwering the expreſſions of it; for the poſition doth not ſay, that God elected men upon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of their embracing the means, but the ſubſtance that is in it, is that God ſaw ſome men embracing the means thoſe he elected; and therefore if it had anſwered to it, it ſhould have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thus, Then God hath not elected thoſe men which he ſaw embracing the means of ſalvation; and then it had been ſo palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly falſe, that it muſt needs have been denied without any further trouble; but as it is it may be a truth, and yet proves nothing in the poſition to be falſe.]</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:65253:36"/>Sir, what need all theſe frothy words to waſt time and to ſpoile clean paper? you know my ſenſe is, that the embracing of the means is not a motive or moving cauſe for which God doth elect, and howſoever it is that you are aſhamed to outface ſo much clear light of the Scripture which confirms this truth, but that your pretence is, that you except againſt my Argument in reſpect of the terms of it, becauſe (as you ſay) it varieth from the Poſition, not anſwering the expreſſions of it:</p>
            <p>The ſubſtance whereof is this, that God ſaw ſome men embracing the means, thoſe he elected. Therefore now I muſt deal plainly &amp; roundly with you, and ſhall unkennel you our of yout fox-holes.</p>
            <p>You know the Water-men on the <hi>Thames</hi> when they cry <hi>Weſtward Hoe,</hi> they have their faces Eaſtward; So whiles you here pretend againſt motives, incentives, or procuring cauſes of election, yet in very deed and truth, you are moſt mainly for them, as I ſhall, God aſſiſting me, make plainly to appear.</p>
            <p>Sir, poſſible it is, that you may not dive into the bottom of this myſtery of Iniquity, nor foreſee at ſuch a diſtance as you are, into the depth of this deſign, and therefore may with the more confidence proteſt againſt, and utterly diſclaim all motives, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centives, or procuring grouds or cauſes why God elects any, but aſcribe all to the good pleaſure of his will, as in words you ſeem to aſſert.</p>
            <p>But if we caſt a reflexe eye upon this Hereſie [I mean for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal cauſes of election] as it was at firſt hatched by <hi>Pelagius,</hi> though ſhortly after it was cruſhed by a Councel, and next again revived in part by the Semipelagian Papiſts, and at laſt refined and put into a new garbe, by thoſe Interpolators, your correſpondents the <hi>Arminians,</hi> it will be very viſible to all conſiderate men, that howſoever in words you deny any moving cauſe in reſpect of election, yet ſo long as the ſubſtance thereof is contained in your Poſitions, and that you grant the force and virtue of a moving cauſe unto faith in reſpect of Gods electing, it muſt thence be concluded that you aſſert ſome moving cauſes, and</p>
            <p>That faith is lookt upon by you as a moving cauſe will appear by theſe enſuing Arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I know it will not be ſtood upon by you, nor any of your gang, that faith is a condition or qualification ſo lookt upon by God, as that without which he doth not elect, no (as we affirm) that to ſuch perſons ſo elected he decrees to give it, but (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65253:37"/>
to you) that where he finds it (which is the ſenſe of their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight) there or thoſe he will elect; and if thus, tell me in ſober ſadneſs, what difference can you make between a qualification or condition wherein God placeth his purpoſe and decree, and that which we call a moving cauſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In election you make believers the adequate object thereof, and faith is made the formal reaſon of this object; now this is a known axiome to thoſe verſed in theſe controverſies, <hi>Ratio for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malis adaequati objecti ſemper eſt ſpecificans cauſa illius habitus, potentiae vel actus cujus eſt objectum.</hi> That the formal reaſon of the adequate object is alwaies a ſpecifying cauſe of the habit, power, or act whereof it is the object. So a thing that is good, being apprehended by the intellect is the cauſe of willing, becauſe it hath the reaſon of its formal object.</p>
            <p>So after the ſame manner when you ſet down faith in reſpect of election as the formal reaſon of the object, and that (as you teach) God hath from without himſelf proper cauſes of willing, you can give no juſt reaſon why we may not ſay, that you make faith the cauſe of election.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This moreover I believe you wil not deny, that what place infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity hath in the point of Reprobation, the like ſhould faith have in the point of election (as being oppoſite ſpecies:) But (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to you) infidelity is not onely affirmed to be the cauſe of Reprobation, but the contrary doctrine is cryed down by you as moſt abominable, and therefore in election, ſhould faith be the cauſe thereof.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If faith doth determine the will of God (being otherwiſe indifferent) to chooſe one rather then another, then it is a cauſe of election: But (according to you) faith hath this determining power, for (with you) beſides faith and the embracing of the means nothing antecedes the decree of election which is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the non-elect, and nothing that is common doth deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; and therefore it is neceſſary, that the reaſon of the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination be placed in faith and embracing of the means; ſo that notwithſtanding all your fair flouriſhes of denyal of motives, cauſes and in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>entives, I muſt needs conclude that you do (at leaſt implicitly) aſſert faith foreſeen in thoſe that will believe is the motive cauſe and procuring ground of Gods electing any to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>And thus I conceive my firſt Argument ſtands in its full ſtrength
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65253:37"/>
notwithſtanding the aſſaults of your dudgeon dagger drawn aginſt it: So that this may be enough to thoſe who are wiſe to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that which is good; and for others I ſhall ſit down quietly upon <hi>Solomons</hi> account, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.22. <hi>Though thou ſhouldeſt bray a fool in a morter with a peſtle, yet will not his fooliſhneſs depart from him.</hi>

            <p>But in the cloſe of this you except againſt ſome of thoſe porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Scripture by me cited, ſaying [It is to be minded that the people ſpoken of in thoſe Scriptures by him quoted out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.7, 8. and 10.15. are ſaid in the firſt verſe of the ſeventh Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>to be a holy people unto the Lord their God;</hi> and thoſe people which are ſaid at that time to be a holy people, and choſen to be a ſpecial people unto the Lord their God, above all the people that were upon the face of the earth, afterwards, for their murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt God, and tempting of him ten times, and not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening to his voice, were deſtroyed in the wilderneſs, and their carcaſſes fell in the wilderneſs through their unbelief: and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ſaith God, you ſhall not come into the land concerning which I ſware to make you dwell therein, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.29, 30. and thus they came to know his breach of promiſe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 34. See alſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.16, 17, 18, 19.</p>
            <p>Sir, this excurſion of yours I imagine is intended upon another account, <hi>viz.</hi> to lay a ſtumbling-block in the Saints way that they may fall away from grace received: for in ſo far as I made uſe of them to prove that there was no external motive in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, neither of holineſs nor believing, for which God did ſet his love upon them to elect them, thoſe places alledged will carry it clear enough.</p>
            <p>And therefore to what you mind, that they are called, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>a Holy people:</hi> I hope you will diſtinguiſh of the holineſs of a people.</p>
            <p>There is firſt, an external and federal holineſs, and this they had by circumciſion, outward profeſſion, and as being viſible covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Internal and real holineſs, wrought onely by the finger of God, in changing of their natures, and making of them new creatures: tis the firſt that is here meant, and not the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
            <p>And whereas you write (that theſe people which are here called a holy people fell in the wilderneſs through unbelief) Sir,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65253:38"/>
I muſt tell you, that I do not take you to be ſo excellent at Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nography, as to make it appear, that they were theſe numerical people here ſpoken of,<note place="margin">See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny God not well pleaſed.</note> that ſo fell in the wilderneſs. But admit they were, it is ſaid, their carcaſſes fell in the wilderneſs, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> they died in the wilderneſs; but what followes hence? did they all therefore fall into hell? <hi>Abſit,</hi> God forbid that any one ſhould make ſuch a deſperate concluſion.</p>
            <p>But youl'e ſay, they fell through unbelief, yet I muſt tell you that though they wanted that hiſtorical faith in not believing the relations of the ſearchers of the land of Canaan,<note place="margin">See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. they drank of that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual rock and that rock was Chriſt. Numb. 23.19.</note> yet they might have a ſaving and juſtifying faith in believing Chriſt ſhould be crucifyed for them, notwithſtanding what is here or can be alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the contrary.</p>
            <p>But why you ſet theſe words [and thus they came to know his breach of promiſe] in words at length and not in figures, I am unwilling to deliver my thoughts; But do you think that God is a man that he ſhould lye, or as the ſon of man, that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent? hath he ſaid, and ſhall he not do it; or hath he ſpoken, and ſhall he not make it good?<note place="margin">Iſa. 46.10.</note> no, his counſel ſhall ſtand, and he will do all his pleaſure.</p>
            <p>But this is ſpoken by an Anthropopathy, bringing in God to do after the manner of men, for our weak capacities.</p>

            <p>God had promiſed them, ſworne to them, that they ſhould enter into Canaan, but they brought up an evil report concerning that land, they murmured againſt God, who hereupon told them, that they ſhould not come into that land, but wander fourty years in the wilderneſs, till their carcaſſes were waſted, and ſo they ſhould know his breach of promiſe, or altering his purpoſe (as the margin hath it.) Had they made good their promiſe he would have made good his promiſe, but becauſe they brake with him in ſinning, he brake with them in puniſhing, and ſo here was exact juſtice, <hi>lex talionis.</hi> The like we have <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.59.

            <p>Having ſet this buttreſs to my firſt Argument, and throughly fortified it againſt all your crooked engines, I am now ready to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65253:38"/>
to what you have to ſay againſt my ſecond argument, which is this.</p>
            <p>If the Patriarch <hi>Iacob</hi> was elected meerly out of Grace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſpect had to any of his faith, works, or uſe of means, then all others are likewiſe ſo elected, for there is the one alike motive for the election of all as of one.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Iacob</hi> was elected meerly out of the good will of God, without any reſpect had to faith, works, or uſe of means, at leaſt for the moving of God to elect him: Therefore all others are ſo elected.</p>
            <p>Whereto you begin thus to anſwer, Firſt, I cannot but mind thoſe words that fall from his pen in the cloſe of his argument, at leaſt, ſaith he, for the moving of God to elect him; certainly either it was his mind to give out ſomething, as though the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition had ſaid that mens faith, works, and uſe of means did move God to elect, then when the word <hi>works</hi> was not there at all; for had it been in it without an explanation of it, I ſhould not have vindicated the poſition, but as it is, I muſt maintain the truth of it againſt all oppoſers whatſoever, neither is there any thing in it as that faith, or uſe of means doth move God to the electing of any men, or elſe ſurely his heart ſmote him, or his own conſcience did accuſe him, that he had excluded the uſe of means wholly in the electing of men to life and ſalvation, as if God had no reſpect to it upon any account whatſoever, and yet ſhould take pay for preaching, as if it were a thing of great worth upon that account.</p>

            <p>And I now ſhall tell you this, that theſe words (for the moving of God to elect him) did neither caſually nor by check of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience drop from my pen, but very conſiderately, for the better illuſtration of the ſenſe of the Argument; and therefore whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever your diſclaimer is, as that nothing is implied in the poſition, whence to conclude your admitting of external motives in the object, by way of condition, qualification, or thing prerequiſite for, or according to which God doth elect, and thereby become a motive or incentive for Gods electing, and ſo not ſingly and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply

               </gap> arguments made to appear in the defence of the former Argu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, that in reality of truth (according to you) faith, embracing of the means, &amp;c. are concauſes or incentives for God to elect.</p>
            <p>And why you ſhould grumble (as in this and ſeveral times af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you do) that I inſert works, with faith, and uſe of means in my argument, I know no cogent reaſon you can have for it; for as for works (whereby I mean a conformable walking according to the mind and will of Ieſus Chriſt) they being <hi>via regni,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11.6. Heb. 12.14.</note> they are every way as neceſſary unto ſalvation as faith it ſelf is: for as without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God; ſo without holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</p>
            <p>And therefore that I yoke the Papiſt with the Anabaptiſt, I ſhall only ſay,<note place="margin">Matth. 20.13, 14.</note> friend I do thee no wrong, <hi>tolle quod tuum eſt et vad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> for ought I ſee you are no holier then they; their foreſeen works carrie as much colour of truth as your foreſeen faith, and both alike, both of them neceſſary, and concurrent to ſalvation, but both of them and all things elſe (out of God) excluded from election, his alone will and good pleaſure being the ſole riſe and fountain why any is elected, and yet as God doth elect unto glory and ſalvation as the end, ſo he doth elect unto grace, unto faith, unto good works, as the way and means conducing to that end.</p>
            <p>You ſecond what you have begun, and ſay [that the Patriarch <hi>Iacob,</hi> and all others that are elect, are elected meerly of grace without any reſpect had to their works, if it be meant meerly the works of the Law; but that <hi>Iacob,</hi> or any other man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whatſoever is elected without any reſpect had to faith or uſe of means I do deny.]</p>
            <p>This to me ſeems a bold attempt, and a plain contradiction, that any thing ſhould be meerly <hi>(i. e.)</hi> ſolely and ſingly of grace, and yet with a reſpect had to faith and uſe of means. If the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Argument be good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. If of grace then not of works, becauſe grace excludes all other things beſides it ſelf, if it be meerly grace then certainly it muſt be as concluding here, if of grace then not from any reſpect had to faith or uſe of means (which laſt in plain Engliſh is nothing elſe but good works) which God hath ordained that we ſhould walk in them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. That ſame grace excluding all other things beſides, as to the decree it ſelf of election, Though I alwaies did and ſhall affirm, that the ſame gracious God, that ſo freely, without any reſpect had to any

thing in thoſe he did elect, did decree to ſave them; So he did decree to ſave them by faith in his Son, and through good works to bring them to glory.</p>
            <p>The next thing you endeavour, is to commit a rape upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. and to defloure the purity of that Scripture, by your falſe gloſs upon it, which you dictate thus.</p>
            <p>[For the Scripture in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11. which is that which he bringeth to prove his Argument, proveth no ſuch thing, but the contrary; for although it was ſaid to <hi>Rebecca</hi> before the children were yet borne, neither having done any good or evil, that the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </label> The reſult of all this nothing amounts onely to this, that the Apoſtle in that chapter his intended ſcope is to exclude works, and to entertain faith in the ſtead thereof. But truly Sir, I am very jealous, or confident rather, that if you were well canvaſt about it, that whiles you undertake to be a teacher of others,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.7</note> yet you underſtand not what you ſay, or whereof you affirm.</p>
            <p>For this I ſo poſitively affirm,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.17.</note> that as all works are not excluded from a juſtified perſon, they being for neceſſary uſes, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.14 Chriſt not coming to deſtroy the law but to fulfill it,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.3.</note> and to caſt down the merit of our works, and to declare that they could have no juſtification by them as being weak through the fleſh.</p>
            <p>So neither is faith uſhered in by <hi>Paul</hi> here in the room (as
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65253:40"/>
you phraſifie it) of works, as by the excellency thereof it could juſtifie us before God,) much leſs be any waies inſtrumental to our election, as this Athenian babler ſeems to innovate.</p>
            <p>For whereas you contradiſtinguiſh the Law of faith (ſpoken of under that term, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.3. and 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.11.) to the law of works.</p>
            <p>You muſt know that the Goſpel is called a law of faith, becauſe the promiſe of Grace in Chriſt is propounded with Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement that men believe it: But now we deny that faith juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies us, as it is a work which we performe in obedience to this law; It juſtifies us onely, as the condition required of us, and as an inſtrument of embracing Chriſts righteouſneſs; no Sir, it is not the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>credere</hi> or the act of believing that hath any ſuch efficacy, for ſo it is a work of our own, and ſo as much turned out of doors, as any other of our good works, Our believing being impure and but in part; Lord I believe, help mine unbelief, and ſo altogether unable to juſtifie, for that muſt be done by a perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But whatſoever is here or any where elſe in Scripture ſpoken to the advance and honour of faith is to be underſtood of faith objectively <hi>(i. e.)</hi> Chriſt believed on by faith, that doth ſupply to our perfect juſtification,<note place="margin">Iſa 64.6. Phil. 3.8.</note> when all the merits of our Righteouſneſs are but as filthy raggs, yea dung and loſs compared with Chriſt.</p>
            <p>So that it is not properly faith, that is, a believers evangelical Righteouſneſs, whereby he is juſtified, but Chriſt ſet up as the brazen ſerpent, and laid hold on by faith the ſouls organ and hand, to receive him that is our Righteouſneſs, <hi>Ier.</hi> 23.6. <hi>the Lord our Righteouſneſs.</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. Chriſt is made to us wiſdome, Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>But that I may more clearly reſcue this eminent portion of Scripture out of ſuch ſoule fingers who lay violence upon it, and by their tricks of legerdemain make a <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> confuſion of election; with juſtification, as this jugler doth here, and all along as you ſhall find, forcing upon election that which is peculiar to Juſtification, not diſtinguiſhing the decree of election from juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, which is onely the means for the execution of the decree; the ordinary ſlur that this ſociety of people would put upon us. I ſhall by the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit, give you the genuine ſcope and ſenſe of the Apoſtle in this Chapter.</p>
            <p>In the former Chapter the Apoſtle had been treating of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65253:40"/>
in theſe three next Chapters he treats of Predeſtination, but this is occaſioned by way of Anticipation. For againſt the Doctrine of Juſtification it might be objected; If the Doctrine of Juſtification by faith alone were true, then it would be received by the Jewiſh nation: But the Jews diſclaim that Doctrine, at leaſt the greateſt part of them, <hi>(ergo)</hi> it cannot be true.</p>
            <p>The firſt Propoſition the Apoſtle denies, and anſwers to the reaſon of it, teaching that not all the Jews are to be accounted the people of God, who are partakers of the outward promiſes, but onely thoſe who do believe the promiſes of grace; and that whereas they are but few that do believe, and that moſt of the Jews do not believe, this doth wholly reſt on the ſecret will and Predeſtination of God, who hath elected ſome unto ſalvation for the manifeſtation of his mercy, and hath not elected or reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted others, according to his unfathomable juſtice.</p>
            <p>Upon which Reprobation did depend the rejection of the greateſt part of the Jews of that time, and the calling of the Gentiles in their ſtead. This is the general ſcope of this Chapter.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe a doctrine of this nature muſt needs be a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-block of offence unto the Jews, therefore in the five firſt verſes he inſinuates into their good opinion, intimating his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt boſome-love unto them, and extols them for many prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives wherein they did outſtrip other nations: and yet withall he expreſſeth his ſorrow when he conſiders that they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected of God and appointed to deſtruction.</p>
            <p>In the ſix and ſeventh verſes he meets with an objection which in ſubſtance was thus, <hi>If the Iews be rejected, then the Covenant that God made with Abraham and his ſeed is of no effect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is not ſo, <hi>(ergo)</hi> not the other.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle here denies the ſequel of the Major Propoſition, and renders a reaſon of ſuch his denial, by a diſtinction of a double ſort of the children of <hi>Abraham, viz.</hi> 1. Children of the fleſh. 2. Children of the Promiſe; and thence informs them, that the Covenant doth properly belong to the children of the Promiſe, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> to the elect Jews. Therefore howſoever the children of the fleſh for the moſt part of them be rejected, yet the Covenant of God remains ſure and firm towards the children of the Promiſe, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> towards the elect Jews. This diſtinction he confirms by a ſpecial example of the two ſons of <hi>Abraham,</hi> viz. <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> whereof the firſt was onely a ſon according to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65253:41"/>
the fleſh <hi>(i. e.)</hi> begotten carnally of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Hagar,</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> other was a ſon of promiſe <hi>(i. e.)</hi> by virtue of the Promiſe begot<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten by <hi>Abraham,</hi> on <hi>Sarah.</hi> Now the Covenant of God or onely appertain unto <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and the reſt of the ſons of Promiſe <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the elect prefigured by him, which the Apoſtle proves b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the teſtimony of God himſelf, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.12.</p>
            <p>Now from this ſpecial example of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> in <hi>ver.</hi> 8, 9. The Apoſtl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> gathers a general Doctrine, to wit, that the p omiſe of Grace made unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> did belong onely to the elect, which he ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> children of the Promiſe, becauſe as <hi>Iſaac</hi> by virtue of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was begotten of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah:</hi> ſo the elect (i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> which number <hi>Iſaac</hi> was) are new begotten through the power of the holy Ghoſt, by the promiſe of the Goſpel, and of ſingula<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Grace and mercy are adopted to be the ſons of God. And that <hi>Iſaac</hi> was a ſon of promiſe <hi>(i. e.)</hi> begotten by virtue of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, he proves by the teſtimony of <hi>Moſes, Gen.</hi> 18.10.</p>
            <p>Again, to the confirmation of the former diſtinction of the two-fold filiation, he produceth another example of two brethren, <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> who though they were both of them begotten by <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and of the ſame mother <hi>Rebecca,</hi> and at one time, and the ſame birth, and that <hi>Eſau</hi> had the priviledge of <hi>primogeniture,</hi> yet <hi>Eſau</hi> was rejected of God, and <hi>Iacob</hi> was accepted and admitted, and that before they were born, and therefore had done neither good nor evil: this example the Apoſtle adjoynes unto the former as by a line of gradation, as more efficaciouſly corroborating his intended purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that the promiſe of Grace doth not indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently and equally belong to all the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but onely to the elect.</p>
            <p>For in the former example of <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the Jews might except againſt it, thus, that <hi>Iſmael</hi> was deſervedly rejected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was not born of <hi>Abrahams</hi> lawful wife <hi>Sarah,</hi> but of the handmaid <hi>Hagar;</hi> but that they, <hi>viz.</hi> the Jews, were by lineal deſcent the undoubted poſterity of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the lawful Heir of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah.</hi> Therefore the Apoſtle ſhewed that the Promiſe of Grace doth yet neither belong to all the children of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> for that <hi>Eſau</hi> was reiected, the brother of <hi>Iacob,</hi> one copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, one conception, one birth; and if any precedency, that falls to <hi>Eſaus</hi> ſhare, for that he was the firſt-born.</p>
            <p>The Argument which the Apoſtle uſeth, looks thus.</p>
            <p>If the promiſe of grace, (<hi>viz.</hi> I will be the God of thee and of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65253:41"/>
thy ſeed) ſhould promiſe adoption or filiation to all the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> it ſhould equally appertain to <hi>Eſau</hi> as well as <hi>Iacob:</hi> the reaſon is, becauſe in all things there is a parity, one father, one mother, one birth, and to boot, <hi>Eſau</hi> the firſt-born. Therefore the promiſe did not belong to <hi>Eſau,</hi> but onely to <hi>Iacob,</hi> and this he proves by two texts of Scripture. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the promiſe of Grace doth not promiſe (as the Jews falſely thought) adoption and eternal life to all and every mothers ſon of the Jews begotten after the fleſh either by <hi>Abraham</hi> or <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac,</hi> and therefore God is no covenant-breaker, if he do reject the ſtubborn and unbelieving Jews.</p>
            <p>Neither could the Jew: alledge againſt this, that <hi>Eſau</hi> was a prophane perſon, and behaved himſelf ill, therefore was deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly rejected, and on the contrary, that <hi>Iacob</hi> was godly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, and therefore was he accepted and adopted, and from whom they derived their Pedigree.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle likewiſe overturnes this objection, and teacheth, that there was a diſcovery of the purpoſe of God concerning them both, even then when they had done neither good not evil, yea even before they were born: Yea and leaſt they might object, that this the Lords purpoſe did ariſe from a foreſight of their works, the Apoſtle clearely rejecteth this, and denies that it was of works, or for their works that the one was adopted and the other was rejected,; but affirms the contrary, that both the adoption of the one, and rejection of the other, did ſingly and ſimply flow from the purpoſe and counſel of God; which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms by the teſtimony of God himſelf out of <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.21.</p>
            <p>In the 14.15.16.17. and 18. verſes: Here is another ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, that if the Lord deal ſo unequally with perſons ſo ſuited in an equal rank as <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> in loving one and hating another, then God ſeems to be unjuſt. But the Apoſtle looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the conſequence as no leſs then blaſphemy, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards demonſtrates this denial of the conſequence, <hi>ver.</hi> 15, &amp;c. and therefore the Apoſtle teacheth that though God ſeem to deal unequally with perſons in an equall conſideration, yet he ſtill continues juſt; and for proof hereof adduceth this reaſon, The Lord hath a moſt free power of doing, not bound, (as he is a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign) <hi>and therfore hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will, he hardens:</hi> either of which parts he proves by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Scriptures; that for <hi>mercy, v.</hi> 15, 16. that of <hi>Hardening, v.</hi> 17. but both are contracted and concluded <hi>verſe</hi> 18.</p>

               </hi> which he had produced to anſwer the objection, he makes thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> concluſion of the principal queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> on what doth depend the ſalvation of man, which he reſolves thus, that mans ſalvation doth not depend on his own free-will or endeavour (which before he had demonſtrated by that notable example of <hi>Iacob</hi>) but ſingly and ſolely and onely on the free mercy and grace of God.</p>
            <p>For the reſt of this Chapter, I ſhall ſuſpend till I meet my Gentleman, undertaking to paraphraſe upon this chapter, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at <hi>ver.</hi> 19. and therefore <hi>Haec ſufficient pro nunc.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that this being the genuine ſcope of the Apoſtle in this Chapter, any one may ſee whether faith, works, or the embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the means have any the leaſt ſtroke in, or be at all conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by God, in the great work of his election of any to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as this man would have it.</p>
            <p>But you proceed thus, [yea in that very ninth of the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſheweth cleerely and plainly in the concluſion of all, what he ſaith in the former part of the chapter, ſetting down theſe very wordes in the 30, 31. and 32, <hi>ver.

The Apoſtle anſwers, that although the Gentiles did not follow after righteouſneſs, yet they have attained to the law of righteouſneſs, becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in Chriſt: and on the contrary, that the Jews, though they followed after righteouſneſs, yet they have not attained unto righteouſneſs, becauſe they believe not in Chriſt, but ſeek juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by their own works; and together with this, he ſets forth the cauſe why they believed not in Chriſt, becauſe they were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with, or at him, at which offence of theirs, leſt believers ſhould be offended, he declares that that of old was declared by the Prophet <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.14. and 28.16.</p>

            <p>Nay were any the beſt of men, nay, or of all the men in the world their graces put all in a lump together, the excellency of all thoſe graces, of all thoſe perſons could not amount unto ſuch a value, as to juſtifie any one perſon, and render him acceptable to God.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Eph.</note>But when Chriſt is received by faith, his merit, mediation, and interceſſion, preſents them to God the Father, <hi>holy and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blemiſh,</hi> they are complete in Chriſt. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.28. and 2.10. and 4.12. <hi>Even by thoſe ornaments he hath put on them,</hi> Ezek. 16.14.</p>
            <p>Tis Chriſt who is our Paſſover, our peace, our propitiation, our righteouſneſs, our juſtifier, that reconciles God and man toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Faith of it ſelf is but a creature, and hath no ſuch omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and though it be an uniting and an excellent Grace, yet it is a gift wrought in us by the immediate finger of God, and not of our own ſtrength; yea it is a part of the purchaſe of Jeſus Chriſt, merited by his death and paſſion, <hi>and he gives it to thoſe ſheep that little flock which were given to him of the father, and thoſe ſheep he knows by name,</hi> Joh. 10.3.27. and 13.18.</p>
            <p>You draw near to a concluſion and ſay, [ſo that we may ſee, that although election to life and ſalvation, and to be juſtified in the ſight of God, be not of the law, nor through the law, nor by the deeds of the law, nor yet for faith, and yet it is by faith, and through faith, and in believing, and no where ſaid to be without it, by which it doth appeare, that the putting off faith and works, and the uſe of means altogether, and to ſay, that God had no more reſpect to faith, and the uſe of the means of ſalvation, then he had to the works of the law, in electing and juſtifying perſons in his ſight to eternal life, is a miſtake at leaſt, if it amount not to an error.</p>

               </label> Why Sir, I have often inculcated, that in election the Lord ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately conſults his own glory, and that there is no external con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or qualification in the object, that he hath any ſuch reſpect unto, as that becauſe thereof he doth elect, yea nothing beſides the manifeſtation of his infinitely rich mercy (and to his glory) in extending it to ſuch undeſerving creatures, who had willingly loſt themſelves, and were irrecoverably miſerable, that ſo his name might be had in honour all the world over, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6. <hi>to the praiſe of the glory of his Grace, &amp;c.

            <p>But whereas you ſay [God reſpecteth not perſons] tis falſely alledged as from thoſe places, and you deal in this as the accuſer of the Brethren, the Devil did with Chriſt in citing <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.12.<note place="margin">Mat. 4.6.</note> He curtails the words, and ſo do you, for look on all thoſe Texts by you mentioned, and whereas you ſay he reſpects not perſons, the Scripture hath it, he is not a reſpecter of perſons, or not an accepter of the face of any man, for <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>The word I readily acknowledge uſed <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. comes from the ſame primitive <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> of curioſity coming to hear <hi>Paul</hi> preach, he ſhews that whiles the Jews contradicted and blaſphemed, divers of the Gentiles were brought to believe in Chriſt, but ſome did not: now to any who ſhould demand, why the reſt of the Gentiles ſhould not likewiſe be converted, the reaſon is implyed in the text that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome of them were ordained unto life <hi>(i. e.)</hi> elected, the reſt were not; as many as were ordained unto eternal life believed.</p>
            <p>Wherein is a plain Antitheſis, not onely of the perſons, <hi>ver.</hi> 45, 48. <hi>viz.</hi> of the Jews contradicting and blaſpheming, and of the Gentiles being glad and glorifying the word of the Lord: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the firſt cauſe, according to Gods ordination, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſome were ordained to life, others were not.</p>
            <p n="4">4.

            <p n="5">5. The Evangeliſt uſeth not a participle active, as thus, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as ordained themſelves to eternal life believed; but a participle paſſive, as many as were ordained believed; and therefore it ſpeaks not of any action whereby they had diſpoſed themſelves, but as they were ordained of God.</p>
            <p n="6">6. There is no good conſequence from that place of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.15. the houſe of <hi>Stephanus</hi> have ordained themſelves, or addicted themſelves to the Miniſtery, therefore it is in the power of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer to diſpoſe himſelf to faith or eternal life; for there is one way of thoſe which are believers in diſpoſing themſelves to the miniſtery of the Church, and another of thoſe which as yet do not believe, in reſpect of their diſpoſition to faith and life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal.</p>
            <p>And thus Sir, howſoever hand over head, you have by traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſwallowed down the feculent dreggs of <hi>Socinus</hi> his interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet it is too palpable that <hi>Gloſſa corrumpit textum,</hi> and that it ſounds plain non-ſenſe that the Gentiles were addicted to

            <p>But whether theſe be all the decrees that God hath made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning mans final and everlaſting eſtate, yea and to ſpeak proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether this be any decree of predeſtination at all, wherein no body is predeſtinated, elected nor reprobated.</p>
            <p>Sir, theſe expreſſions that you repreſent, are onely declaratory publications of the Goſpel, propounded under conditional terms, and obvious in all the Evangeliſts.</p>
            <p>But tell me where I ſhall find, <hi>Et eris mihi magnus Apollo,</hi> If any man doth believe and embrace the means, he ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated, or he ſhall be elected.</p>
            <p>Faith is a product of election, an effect in time flowing from the eternal decree, and not a foreſeen condition or qualification, drawing after it Gods eternal election.</p>
            <p>Tis beyond all queſtion, and we diſpute it not, that God in the ſame eternity, whereby he elected ſome, and paſſed by others; foreſaw in his decree (becauſe he foreſaw what he would either do or ſuffer to be done) he foreſaw I ſay both what the elect, and what the non elect would do, and what contrary ends they would come unto, he being the orderer of them both, of <hi>Eſau</hi> aſwel as <hi>Iacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here ſticks the knot of the queſtion, whether the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent actions of men foreſeen, cauſed the different decrees of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection and reprobation, which we utterly deny, and this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65253:50"/>
on you to prove, which you will do <hi>ad Gracas ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore it is but a wild expreſſion, altogether incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous with the Scripture-phraſe, to ſay, [that God decreed himſelf to be the God and father of ſuch a ſort or kind of people as ſhould embrace the means] give me its parallel and Ile ask you pardon: But Sir, now I remember my ſelf, you have a toleration to ſpeak non-ſenſe.</p>
            <p>For you run along in the ſame ſtrain thus;</p>
            <p>And ſo abſolute and irrevocable is this decree of Gods un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable election, that even the worſt of men, in their natural condition, or any men or women in the world, which do conſider how great things God hath done for them, as they are ſinners, and loſt creatures by reaſon thereof, and return unto their maker in embracing the means of ſalvation, in being changed from their evil courſe of life, departing from ſin, and leaving the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this world, and believe in Jeſus with an upright heart, and with a willing mind; they coming to be ſo changed as aforeſaid, fall into that decree of God that changeth not, and ſo that which was in the purpoſe and decree of God before rime, actually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be put in execution in time, and ſo all the promiſes of God in Chriſt unavoydably come to be the portion of ſuch a changed people, which are <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. turned from darkneſs to light, that they may receive forgiveneſs of ſins, and an inheritance among them that are ſanctified by faith that is in Chriſt Jeſus.]</p>

               </label> Sir, abate me but theſe words [fall into the decree of God] and Ile freely grant you all the reſt; that which you hint at as the inward ſenſe of our own unworthineſs, and relying on the never failing mercies of God in Chriſt, a departing from the ends of our own waies, and a cleaving unto God with a purpoſe of heart, are ſo many lively Characters, evidences, and badges, that ſuch a one was an elect perſon before the foundation of the world was laid, and that that ſame eternal though ſecret decree of mercy towards him before all time, comes now to be put in execution, and manifeſted to all the world in time; and this he knows, in that he is a new creature, and turned from darkneſs to light &amp;c. But to ſay that when theſe Characters or marks are in him, then he falls into the decree of God, is ſuch a peice of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of novelty, that a man ſhall not ordinarily meet with your compeer, thus to confound election with regeneration: but thoſe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65253:50"/>
of your rank are licentiates for ſuch pranks. That which doth enſue in a qualified ſenſe may be digeſted, <hi>viz.</hi> when you ſay, But although our embracing the means of ſalvation, and believing in Jeſus, and obeying his voice, be no meritorious or procuring ground or cauſe why God made ſuch a decree, but that which was the moving cauſe thereof, was his love, as hath been already granted; yet the embracing the means, and believing in Jeſus, and obeying his voice, is of neceſſity to be done by thoſe that have the Goſpel preached unto them, as an inſtrumental cauſe by which the purpoſe and decree of God in order to their everlaſting good cometh to be put in execution, as a way and means appointed of God for that end: and one would think that this man were a little of my mind in this, by what falleth from him in the cloſe of this ſecond Argument, uſing theſe words, at leaſt for the moving of God to elect.]</p>
            <p>Sir, If here, where you make mention of any Inſtrumental cauſe, you intend onely the Inſtrumental means of ſalvation then I joyne with you; for as I have before aſſerted, That as God hath decreed the end, ſo likewiſe hath he decreed the means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to that end: But as there is no external cauſe at all, and therefore none Inſtrumental for which he doth elect before all time, but all ariſing from within himſelf, even his own love and good pleaſure; ſo when that decree comes to be put into executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in time, then there are ſubordinate cauſes, but all ſet on work by the firſt cauſe which is God himſelf, but not as to election, but all as tending to ſalvation: And therefore that fell very adviſedly from me when I ſaid, (at leaſt for the moving of God to elect) where I place a vaſt difference between election and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; God elects without reſpect had to faith, works, or uſe of means, as to the decree, but yet he ſaves with, by and through faith, works, and uſe of means as in reſpect of the end. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2.</p>
            <p>You pack up theſe your fardles of exceptions thus.</p>
            <p>[Now if he do not hold that it is ſome cauſe by which men come to be more peculiarly intereſſed into the favour of God by believing then they are without believing, why did he not rather ſay, it muſt not be accounted any cauſe at all upon any account whatſoever? But it is that which the Lord Chriſt hath ſaid, in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.27. which perſwadeth me to be of that mind, in that he hath ſaid, <hi>the Father himſelf loveth you, becauſe you have
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:65253:51"/>
loved me, and have believed that I came out from God:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore If I ſhould ſay, that loving of Jeſus Chriſt, and believing in him were no cauſe at all, by which we came to be choſen into the Fathers love, I ſhould ſin againſt Chriſt in ſpeaking contrary to his word: But this is more then was in the Poſition, and yet it is no more then truth.]</p>

               </label> Sir, now I will give you an account why I uſed that expreſſion (at leaſt for the moving of God to elect) my meaning was not that any man came to be intereſted into the firſt favour and love of God, which is the good pleaſure of his will immanent and eternal in himſelf, more by believing then without believing.</p>
            <p>For in election God lookt upon men as ſinners, enemies, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, in their blood, in a doleful plight, and the objects of pity and compaſſion, and not as on believers.</p>
            <p>And therefore my words carried this ſenſe, that though there were no cauſe or motive at all, why he ſhould elect one rather then another, becauſe all were in an equally loſt condition; yet in the decree of election wherein there was a love unto and a purpoſe to ſave ſome, he likewiſe decreed to ſave them by ſuch means which in his wiſdome he had ordained to be ſuitable for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the end, ſo that ſalvation ſhould have adequate cauſes for the effecting of it, <hi>viz.</hi> faith, works, and uſe of means, though election it ſelf had none but ſingly and ſimply the love of God ariſing onely out of his own boſome. And therefore it excluded cauſes as to election, but did admit of cauſes as to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of ſalvation.</p>
            <p>For the reſt of this paragraph of yours, it trips up the heeles of all the former your ſeeming fair conceſſions, and plainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the ſecret guile and fraud of your heart.</p>
            <p>For now you begin to ſpeak plain enough, ſaying [If I ſhould ſay believing were no cauſe at all by which we come to be choſen into the Fathers love, I ſhould ſin againſt Chriſt] Here indeed is plain dealing, though all along before you have juggled with me, and denyed all cauſes as to election. And this indeed (though you are not aware of it) mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lders to nothing all your former exceptions, which have ſtill denied all cauſes, motives, &amp;c. And now you grant loving and believing to be cauſes; and confirms every argument that I have raiſed, and fortifies every of thoſe abſurdities that I have charged upon you, as following upon your poſition, to any of which you make not the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of an anſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:65253:51"/>But I tell you as before, God in electing lookt upon men as in the corrupt maſs and lumpe of perdition, regarding nothing what they could be as of themſelves, for they muſt unavoidably be in a loſt condition, till by his own act tranſient flowing from that of Immanent in himſelf, he made them believers, by giving of them faith, and all of this for the greater advance of his own free grace, which he did not do to others.</p>
            <p>For that place of <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.27. brought to confirm their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I anſwer, that the love of God hath a two-fold acception.</p>
            <p>The firſt is <hi>amor benevolentiae,</hi> which is the foundation and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all the good his people have and receive; tis the wombe that conceives and ſends forth all the good things we do enjoy; of which <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.3. <hi>I have loved thee with an everlaſting love,</hi> and ſo 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.10. <hi>we love him, becauſe he loved us firſt,</hi> and of this no cauſe or reaſon can be rendred, beſides the good pleaſure of his will. The ſecond is <hi>amor complacentiae,</hi> when in time the Lord is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the perſons of thoſe that he loved from eternity, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.14. <hi>thy beauty was perfect through the comelineſs I put upon thee.

            <p>And now gather up altogether, and make up your accounts, and ſee to what an excreſcency of advantage your numerous excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt my arguments will amount unto, and you ſhall find that the

            <p>[This Scripture ſaith nothing at all of Reprobation, or mans deſtruction, but of the Predeſtinating, or appointing of believers to the Adoption of children by Jeſus Chriſt.]</p>

               </label> Tis very true Sir, that the letters and ſyllables of that word Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation is not <hi>in terminis</hi> expreſt in that text cited, of <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.5. but if by a neceſſary and an unavoidable conſequence it may be thence concluded, I hope it will be as ſufficient as though in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs words it had been ſo declared.</p>
            <p>The words are recorded, as for the comfort and encouragement of elect believers, in beholding of the certainty and ſtability of their Predeſtination, and Election, reſting in the boſome of God and the counſel of his will: So likewiſe to keep them in an humble poſture, and engage them to a continual duty of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, that when as they were in the ſame corrupt maſs and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65253:52"/>
lump of perdition with others the worſt of men, yet the Lord meerly out of the good pleaſure of his will, and from no other argument or motive out of themſelves, did fix his love upon them and predeſtinated them to the Adoption of children.</p>
            <p>But was there not then the ſame good pleaſure of his wil, in the preterition, non-election, or not predeſtinating to the Adoption of children, the reſt that were paſt by, who in reſpect of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, were in as great and as good a capacity of partaking of any indulgence, as thoſe that were elected? and what will this then amount unto, but to be non-elected, which is the ſame as to be Reprobated, according to the good pleaſure of his will, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume all the art you have cannot aſſign a <hi>medium</hi> between the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, or at leaſt make two decrees, of predeſtinating of ſome men, and the not predeſtinating of others, but that if ſome men were not predeſtinated or not elected, they muſt thence neceſſarily be reprobated.</p>
            <p>He give you a familiar inſtance; Suppoſe ten men for the evil deeds that they have committed be arraigned, indicted, convicted, and adjudged to death, but that immediately before the time of execution, an act of Grace or ſpecial Pardon iſſues out from the ſupreme Magiſtrate, and relaxes and freely remits the puniſhment to five of thoſe ten, I hope you may hence ſafely conclude, that the other five ſhall be executed.</p>
            <p>So let us ſuppoſe that the number of mankind are two Millions of men; If out of theſe by the eternal and unchangeable decree of God, one Million onely be infallibly appointed and ordained to eternal life, (they being all alike equally culpable and liable to eternal wrath and death) who can deny but that the other Million are alſo as abſolutely compriſed under that ſentence of eternal death, whereinto they had hurled themſelves? as the decree of predeſtination or election ſaves ſome of meer good pleaſure, ſo the ſame decree of preterition, non election, non predeſtination, leaves the reſt where it found them, weltring in their own gore, and ſo reprobates them.</p>
            <p>I hope you will not (with the Papiſts in another like kind) make a <hi>limbo non praedeſtinatorum ſeu non electorum,</hi> ſuch as ſhall neither go to heaven or hell.</p>
            <p>And this of the decree of God before all time.</p>
            <p>But when it pleaſeth God who ſeparated ſuch from the mothers womb to reveal his Son unto them in time,<note place="margin">Gal. 1.16.</note> then it is after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:

               </gap> faith, repentance, and perſeverance; and the manner of Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the non-elect to run themſelves on the rock of eternal death, is by leaving them in their own natural blindneſs, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe enmity of their own imbred corruptions, and nor ſupplying them with any reſtraining, aſſiſting, or ſaving grace, being not bound unto his creature ſo to do, without which they muſt una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voydably wallow in their own mire, and out of which they are never able to extricate themſelves, but are juſtly by God ſuffered to continue in their infidelity and impenitency.</p>
            <p>Farther I ſay, that the formal decree of election contains an abſolute and an eternal decree of preparing of effectual grace for thoſe that are ſo elected: But the formal decree of negative Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation or non-election, an abſolute &amp; eternal decree of not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring this effectual grace for thoſe who are ſo pretermitted. From whence is plain, that the divine previſion of faith, works, and uſe of means in the elect, ſo likewiſe the continuing in ſin and unbeliefe in the nonelect, doth not nor cannot go before the forementioned decree as you vainly imagine, but are concomitant and coordinate in and with the decree; and that when ſome are predeſtinated and elected to the Adoption of children, out of the good pleaſure of Gods will,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.12.</note> Others are not predeſtinated, not elected, but repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated according to the ſame good pleaſure of his will, and ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main aliens from the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſtrangers from the covenant of promiſe, having no hope, and never made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the joy of the elect.<note place="margin">Pro. 14.10.</note>

            <p>From the 1. <hi>ver.</hi> to the 20. of it is compriſed a propheſie of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:65253:53"/>
deliverance to the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from the captivity of <hi>Babylon.</hi> In the 6 firſt verſes this is declared that God will do it. That which was the main obſtruction which hindered the work, was the murmuring of the people that they were ſo long in captivity, as though that God had dealt unjuſtly with them, in ſuffering the <hi>Babylonians</hi> to oppreſs them ſo long. Againſt this, God aſſerts his own juſtice, partly from the baſeneſs and vileneſs of them that did ſo murmur, partly from the Majeſty of him againſt whom they did murmur; both of which he illuſtrates by two examples, one was feigned, where is brought in the potſheard contending with his maker, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. woe unto him that ſtriveth with his maker, let the potſheard ſtrive with the potſheards of the earth; ſhall the clay ſay to him that faſhioneth it, what makeſt thou? or thy work, he hath no hands?</p>
            <p>Wherein expoſtulating with the murmuring <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſuffered their captivity ſo long, he vindicates his own power and ſovereignty over all his creatures the work of his hands, and therefore that he hath a free diſpoſing power over them, to do with them what ſhall ſeeme good in his own eyes. They were but as clay in the hands of the potter, baſe, vile, contemptible, (compared with God their maker) fram'd of a lump of earth: and therefore if the potter have ſo much power when he hath made a veſſel to daſh it in pieces; hath not God much more power to diſpoſe of his own fabricke, without a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute had with ſinful fleſh, and to be made obnoxious to render an acount for his ſo doing?</p>
            <p>And I pray, wiſe Sir, reviſe my writing again, and ſee whether this text of <hi>Iſa.</hi> is not moſt appoſite to prove ſo much as I intended it for, which howſoever it was not ſpecifically to Reprobation <hi>in terminis,</hi> yet it clearly proves the abſolute ſovereignty and power that God hath over all his creatures that he hath made, to put them into what condition he ſhall pleaſe, without any replication to be made by the creature: he is Lord Paramount of our lives, eſtates, and fortunes, and hath the Keyes both of Hell and death,<note place="margin">Rev. 1.18.</note> and as he is Lord of his creatures may daſh in pieces, and ſend to hell the greateſt majeſty on earth, without the control of any:<note place="margin">Job 9.12.</note> who can hinder him, or who ſhall ſay unto him what doſt thou? And did I cite that text to any other purpoſe then to prove this abſolute ſovereignty? as moſt expreſly it doth, notwithſtanding your put blind eyes could not diſcern it.</p>

            <p>And ſurely Sir, if you be a man of reaſon (whereof your wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings give me cauſe to doubt) I muſt tel you that your ſuppoſed er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror either muſt be in the firſt aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is no other ground or reaſon aſſigned for Reprobation, either of Sin or unbelief, or the rejecting of the means, but the meer good pleaſure of Gods moſt holy will, and this is but <hi>Idem per idem,</hi> a trifling of words, or barely without proof of contradiction to deny, it is but <hi>petitio principii,</hi> a bare and baſe begging of the queſtion: Or elſe it muſt be comprehended in this, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſin and unbelief, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting of the means, are the proper and meritorious cauſes why God decrees ſuch perſons to hell and eternal torments, which, ſo far as I perceive by you, neither of us do deny.</p>
            <p>And yet I muſt put in ſome caution (becauſe you are ſo apt to miſunderſtand) 1. That Gods foreſight of ſin, unbelief and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting of the means (which he is no waies bound to prevent) is not affirmed to be a cauſe why this man rather then another is not elected, it is only as a certain note and infallible conſequent of men not elected.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:65253:54"/>
               <hi>Cauſa probationis non rei ipſius;</hi> And whereas I do aſſert that negative Reprobation which is Gods abſolute, eternal and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table decree of not electing, depends only on Gods free pleaſure, as he is Lord and Soveraign over all his creatures, and may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate all, or do with them elſe whatſoever he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>Yet damning, or decreeing, ſuch perſons to hell and eternal torments, being an act of Judiciary power and proceeding accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the tenor of the revealed Goſpel, that never proceeds according to the forementioned good pleaſure, but is ſuited ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to mens ſeveral actions and demerits.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I do not affirm that this decree doth impoſe any neceſſity upon the non-elect, or reprobated, that they ſhould unavoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably ſin, or that it excludes all ſuch perſons from all poſſible means of ſalvation, that ſo they may juſtly and immutably be damned; Onely I aſſert, that together with this free good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of non election or reprobation, God foreknoweth that ſuch perſons not elected or reprobated, wil out of the freedom of their own wills, neglect and abuſe ſuch means of their ſalvation, and thereby commit ſuch ſins, as, for which ſo foreſeen of God, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him a juſt cauſe of their damnation, whereby he will glorifie himſelf in the manifeſtation of his juſtice upon them.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, I do readily acknowledge that God as he adjudicates none to eternal torments, but ſinners, unbelievers, and rejecters of the means, ſo hath he not decreed to adjudge any but ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell and eternal torments; from both of which it follows, that ſin and unbelief is the cauſe of the adjudication to hell and eternal torments, and that by the decree of God, but is by no means the cauſe of the decree it ſelf that ſingly proceeds from his good pleaſure.</p>
            <p>And as it is an undoubted truth, that God, as he never ſaves any adult perſon, but ſuch as are penitent and ſtudious of good works; ſo he hath not decreed to ſave any but ſuch ſo qualified with repentance and good works; whence we argue, that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and good works are truly the cauſes of ſalvation,<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2.13.</note> and that by the decree of God, who hath from the beginning choſen us to ſalvation, through ſanctification of the ſpirit, and belief of the truth: but it doth not thence follow, that repentance and good works are cauſes of the decree; for upon that account, election ſhould be dependent, not onely upon faith foreſeen, as you would have it, but likewiſe upon good works as antecedent to it, which
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65253:55"/>
hitherto (for ought I ſee) you have not that impudence to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme. The like muſt be ſaid of reprobation.</p>
            <p>That as he never damns or decrees to torment and adult perſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſuch as are impenitent unbelievers and rejecters of the means: ſo he hath not decreed to damn any but ſuch ſo qualified: and whence the like Argument may likewiſe be taken up, that impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent unbelief and rejecting of the means are truly the cauſes of damnation,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.6. Heb. 12.14.</note> and that by the decree of God, who hath declared that without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe him, and that without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord: But it doth not thence follow, that impenitence, unbelief, and the rejecting of the means are the cauſes of the decree; reprobates were not ſinners (at leaſt in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence) when the decree of non election or reprobation firſt p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> upon them, which was from all eternity; as the elect were not penitents at the firſt inſtant of their election: in the mean time, God hath not decreed to adjudge any but ſinners and unbelievers unto eternal torments, as he hath not decreed to reward any with eternal life but penitents. For what God doth or permitteth to be done in time, the ſame and no otherwiſe hath God decreed to be done, or permitted to be done before all time; ſo that the previſion of ſin and unbelief, and rejecting of the means, did no more antecede negative reprobation, then the previſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and good works did antecede the decree of election.</p>
            <p>So that I hope reaſonable men will or may now judge that I have reconciled the enmity that your dim deluded ſight had imagined, and broken down that partition-wall which your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick fears raiſed between theſe two poſitions, and by the good hand of God have ſo reconciled your ſuppoſed difference between them, that they go neer like <hi>Hippocrates</hi> twinnes, hard <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So that now I am at liberty to attend to what you will ſay to my firſt Argument, which is this.</p>
            <p>That which the holy Ghoſt in Scripture aſcribes to the ſole will and good pleaſure of God, that we are not to aſſigne to other cauſes: But the Scripture aſſignes reprobation ſoley to Gods will: Therefore,</p>

And what doth he do leſs than give the lye to the Spirit of truth, when (by his own confeſſion) the Scripture aſcribes reprobation to the will of God? which though afterwards he palliates by ſaying that it doth not aſſigne it ſolely to the will of God, but that ſin &amp; unbelief are concomitant cauſes, yet he might have ſhewed ſome ingenuity in alledging of ſuch places of Scripture which had done as he did ſay, that ſo there might have been ſome appearance of an anſwer, and not that <hi>Pythagoras</hi>-like his <hi>ipſe dixit</hi> ſhould be taken for currant coyne, when as I am certaine it is but counterfeit; but to give the lye, and that to his betters (as I am informed) is as ordinary a diſh with him, as his dayly bread.</p>

Now good Sir, if you will vouchſafe to call your ſelf to remembrance by looking into your own poſition; the matter in debate between you and me is not about this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral reprobation, that tranſient act, which is or may be done in time, after the grace of the Goſpel rejected; But tis onely about that reprobation which is eternal, immutable, and immanent in God before all time, even before the foundations of the world were laid.</p>
            <p>And therefore I cannot blame you to write what follows, for I dare affirm that notwithſtanding any decree that God had made before time, there ſhould be none reprobated in time if they did not continue in ſin and unbelief, and the rejecting of the means

Make up a fair concord between theſe jarring ſtrings, and then I will ſay you are good at the ſhutting up of a broken bone; unleſs you will come over to my ſide, and affirm as I do, which is this, that notwithſtanding any ſuch decree of reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before all time, yet there ſhall be none reprobated in time, nay none damned, after that time ſhall be no more, if they did truly and unfeignedly repent them of their ſins, and undoubtedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in and accept of Jeſus Chriſt for their redemption and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, <hi>and ſo cleave unto God with a purpoſe of heart,</hi>

            <p>We have an infalible axiome in the Schools (wherein you are a ſtranger) that <hi>Suppoſitio conditionalis nihil ponit in eſſe,</hi> Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal propoſitions infuſe no hability, or put no capacity in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to accept of or to perform the condition. Further, we have commonly in uſe a vain ſaying, <hi>if the skie fall we ſhall catch Larks;</hi> now it doth not hence follow, that either the skie ſhall fall, or that a man may catch Larks; where ſhall a man ſet his footing, or hold his larking-net, if the skie falls?</p>
            <p>My alluſion is this, that whiles I do conſent, that ſuch who are Reprobated before all time, if they did believe and repent, ſhould not be Reprobated in time, nor damned after time, yet I do not ſay, that therefore it is in their power either to believe or to repent, notwithſtanding they may be accompanied with never ſo much outward means in the day of grace, in order to their ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting good. Nay, I ſay it is impoſſible that ever they ſhould either believe or repent, if once the decree of non election was paſt: Do you chew the cudde upon thoſe words, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.26. <hi>You believe not, becauſe you are not of my ſheep:</hi> and <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.39. <hi>Therefore they could not believe becauſe that Eſaias ſaid, He hath blinded their eyes, and hardned their heart, that they ſhould not ſee with their eyes, nor underſtand with their heart, and be converted, and I ſhould heal them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, for your own ſake, let me perſwade you to underſtand a little better, that non-election or negative Reprobation is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a denial of ſalvation it ſelf unto thoſe that are non-elected, but pretermitted, and left weltring in their own corruption, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that it is a decree of withholding of all grace, which would be <hi>de facto</hi> effectual unto the avoidance of ſin, and ſuch an order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of circumſtances and occaſions, as God certainly knoweth will make them freely run into their ſins, and obſtinately continue in them. And therefore here is that ſtumbling-block which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes an offence, yea in truth it is the main knot in this buſineſs; you very fondly imagine that whiles God accompanies perſons non-elected or Reprobated, with outward means in the day of Grace (as you phraſifie it) in order to their everlaſting good, that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65253:57"/>
then it is in the power of that mans freewill, to accept or refuſe of that means ſo tendered; whereas this is a heavenly writ from the truth of Gods revealed will in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>God in his eternal purpoſe hath denyed, decreed not to give to ſuch the uſe of that freedom to good which was loſt in <hi>Adam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.5.

               </label> Noble Sir, take it not amiſs that here again I pull you by the ſleeve, and tell you that you are like a ſtragling ſheep making a frivolous digreſſion from the matter in conteſt: keep your wits about you, and mind this, that our diſpute is about reprobation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all time, and your deviation here is by a diſcourſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation in time, wherein we little differ. Onely I muſt informe you of a miſtake in you in this likewiſe, in conceiving that there can be no decree of God, of leaving men to the liberty of their own wills in committing of ſin, that can be antecedent to the guilt of actual ſin.</p>
            <p>I pray, kind Sir, be pleaſed out of your vaſt knowledge to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me, what foregoing or foreſeen ſin was there in our firſt
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65253:58"/>
Parents, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> for which God, out of his vindictive Juſtice, did give them over to the liberty of their own wills, and ſo ſuffered them to eat of the forbidden fruit, thereby breaking the moſt holy and righteous law of God? Or thoſe non-elect Angels <hi>who are now reſerved in everlasting chains under darkneſs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jud. 6.</note> what antecedent ſin can there be imaginable to that their firſt ſin, for which they were forced to leave their own habitation, <hi>and were delivered unto chains of darkneſs to be reſerved unto judgement?</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.4</note>
            </p>
            <p>And what I ſay of theſe the like may be ſpoken of all the non-elected, there is not any one ſin that the heard of Reprobates ever did or ſhall commit, but that Gods decree of ſuffering them to fall into thoſe very ſame ſins, is antedated infinitely before any ſuch ſin is acted. Though I ſhall withall confeſs, that in the very Reprobates, God often in a judiciary way, puniſheth ſin with ſin, turning <hi>malum culpae</hi> into <hi>malum poenae,</hi> and ſo <hi>Vons avez</hi> to my firſt Argument.</p>
            <p>Your next motion of courſe is to my ſecond Argument, which is thus.</p>
            <p>That which is the efflux and conſequence of Reprobation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the cauſe of it: but ſin, and unbelief, and the rejecting of the means are the efflux and conſequence of Reprobation. Therefore.</p>
            <p>The Major is as clear as the Sun.</p>
            <p>The Minor is proved by theſe Texts, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.25, 26. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.36, 37. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.36, 37. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.26. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.39, 40. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.18, 33. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7, 8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8. Whereunto you ſay,</p>
            <p>[To which I anſwer, firſt, by diſtinguſhing upon his Major pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and to enquire into his meaning therein: now if he mean by Reprobation, the decree of God before time, diſtinct from Reprobation in time, or <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.28. <hi>Gods giving them over to a reprobate mind,</hi> which is the execution of the decree, then I deny that ſin and unbelief is the effect of it; for God is ſo far from decreeing and appointing men to commit ſin, or that ſin is an effect that cometh to paſs by his decree and appointment, that he doth not ſo much as tempt any man to ſin, as we may ſee <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.13. yea the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> is ſo far from laying ſin upon Gods decree, as if that ſhould be the cauſe that ſhould produce ſuch an effect as ſin and unbelief, that he ſaith <hi>v.</hi> 14. that every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own luſt, and inticed; and then, <hi>v.</hi> 15. he ſaith, <hi>when luſt hath conceived it bringeth forth ſin, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65253:59"/>
ſin when it is finiſhed bringeth forth death:</hi> By which we may ſee that the Apoſtle doth not make Gods decree the cauſe of ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that indeed which is the cauſe which bringeth it forth is even luſt.]</p>

               </label> Here were matter for you to work upon indeed, if I would own the Argument as it is by you thus miſtated, and truly I do not well know how this error crept in, as you have thus tranſlated my ſecond Argument, whether you lookt upon it with a ſquint eye or a wry neck, and ſo had a mind to pervert both the words and ſenſe of it; but I am ſure in mine own written paper, which one alone, and no more I ever had, which is now in my cuſtody, where as your pamphlet hath it.</p>
            <p>[That which is the effect and conſequent of Reprobation] is and ſo ſhould be, [That which is the efflux and conſequent of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation] which one word of effect for efflux doth much vary the caſe, and overthrows, at leaſt ſilenceth a great part, if not all what you have ſaid againſt it; for I utterly diſown the word effect; I know ſin followes negative Reprobation or non-election, not as an effect the cauſe, but as the conſequent flowing from and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing its antecedent, and therefore I proteſt againſt the word as ſpurious and illegitimate, and no brood of my brain.</p>
            <p>But yet if <hi>cauſe</hi> may be lookt upon in the latitude it is many times uſed and taken for, I ſee not, but that in a large ſenſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation may be ſaid to be a cauſe of ſin. <hi>viz. cauſa ſine qua non;</hi> for had there not been ſuch a negative reprobation or non-election, as the mother, ſin, at leaſt actual ſin, had never been born nor brought into the world as the daughter. Had God elected all, at leaſt, had not God decreed to permit the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> and of his poſterity, he had not permitted it at all; for whatſoever he purpoſed to do, or permitted to be done, in time, the ſame he did decree before all time ſo to do, or to permit to be done; and if he had not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſin at all, and ſo decreed to permit it, ſin would never have been, but it muſt have been hindred.</p>
            <p>But I inſiſt not upon this, but apply my ſelf to that member of your diſtinction of Reprobation <hi>viz.</hi> that which is before all time.</p>
            <p>Wherein, for ſo much as is contended for by you in this para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, if I may gratifie you in it, I will ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:65253:59"/>
and totally depraved, and hath little of other proper and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate quality but to ſin; and ſo I come to the other member of your diſtinction, which is worded thus.</p>
            <p>[Secondly, if by Reprobation he meaneth the act or execution of Gods decree in time, which is Gods giving up of people to their own hearts luſt, and to a Reprobate mind, as aforeſaid, then alſo we find that Gods act in the firſt place, is not the cauſe of mans ſin, but mans diſobedience in the firſt place is the cauſe why God doth execute the ſame as his juſt and righteous judgement upon them for their continuance in ſin, &amp;c. as it is expreſſed in this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, as appeareth <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.11, 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. and yet I do not deny but ſin and unbelief may be the effect and conſequence of Reprobation in this ſenſe, as mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying, and not coming in while the door is open, is the cauſe of the door being ſhut againſt them, and the door being ſhut againſt them, is the cauſe of their abiding ſtill with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out: <hi>Wherefore ſtrive to enter in at the ſtraite gate, before the good man of the houſe be riſen up, and hath ſhut to the door, Luke</hi> 13.24, 25. <hi>While it is called to day, leſt any of you be hardned through the deceitfulneſs of ſin, Heb.</hi> 3.13.]</p>

               </label> I wonder why you ſhould think I meant it of Reprobation in time, which is not in the decree about which our controverſie is, but onely the execution of the decree; though this be your practiſe, yet I uſe no ſuch extravagancies as to run from the queſtion, which is onely about Reprobation before all time: and therefore this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring no other anſwer, I proceed to that where you hit the nail on the head, for thus you write.</p>
            <p>But I do partly believe that his meaning by reprobation in his argument, is that which is generally held amongſt them, That Gods will and decree before any thing was brought forth in order, or before man had any being, is the onely and alone cauſe of Reprobation, and ſo conſequently of ſin and unbelief, and the rejecting of the means of ſalvation; and that no other fruits at any time can be brought forth by them, notwithſtanding all that they can do, but that theſe things muſt unavoydably follow, they being bound up thereunto by the decree of God; and that which doth make me inclinable to believe that his meaning is ſo, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I find his Arguments tend much to the maintaining of ſuch a thing.]</p>

            <p>But as I tender the honour and glory of God, in the exaltation of his, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.8, 9. <hi>tender mercies over all his works,</hi> and the purity of that truth and ſincerity that is in himſelf, together with his faithfulneſs in his upright and ſincere dealings towards the ſons of men; and alſo when I think upon the excellency of his wiſdome, I cannot but ſtand up in deteſtation of ſuch a doctrine which ſtriketh at the very being of theſe attributes in God.]</p>

No Sir, I doubt not evidently to make it ſo appear, that our doctrine dorh not in the leaſt degree in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench upon any of the Divine attributes, but that it gives to the moſt High God the honour due unto his name, by exalting him infinitely beyond all the creation, ſhewing their neceſſary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on him in all they have, do, or hope to enjoy: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as your Doctrine whatſoever offers and fair pretences it makes, yet tis no better then <hi>Iaels</hi> bottle of milk to <hi>Siſera,</hi>

               </label> My good friend, I muſt tell you that we utterly abjure that which you infer as a ſequel of our doctrine, and for anſwer unto yours, ſay, that this which his companions the other two ſeeming gravamens, are all alike grounded on a falſe hypotheſis, wherein you diſcover a groſs miſtake, conceiving that non-election or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Reprobation draws along with it an invincible neceſſity of committing of ſin, or that it doth determine mans will to ſin either by compulſion or neceſſity, for which ſuch ſo reprobated are afterwards condemned; but no ſuch inferences can be drawn from our opinions; We ſay the negative will of God is no cauſe at all of mans ſin or miſery, but his own poſitive will is the cauſe both of his wickedneſs and of his wretchedneſs.</p>
            <p>He is the true and principal cauſe of any effect or event, who imployeth his faculties and endeavours to bring it into being, and not he who onely reſolveth not to hinder ſuch evill effects, though he foreſee they will come into being if he prevent them not.</p>
            <p>The infallible previſion of God ſeeth from all eternity the actions of men and their ends, and yet this maketh not the <hi>modus agendi</hi> to be neceſſary or compulſory, but leaveth the agent moſt free, as if he had never foreſeen it: ſo that the abſolute decree of not giving faith, final perſeverance, and eternal life unto the non-elect (which he is no waies bound to do) howſoever it deny them that grace which would effectually and infallibly make them bring forth fruits meet for repentance,<note place="margin">Mat. 3.8.</note> yet it depriveth
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65253:61"/>
them not of their own natural freedome and liberty, neither doth it neceſſitate, compel or conſtrain them unto any their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief or committing or continuing in ſin.</p>
            <p>Tis he and he alone, or chiefly, may well be ſaid to be invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly drawn into ſin, and plunged into and caſt into the like of fire, who fights againſt ſin with all his ſtrength, and ſtriveth to avoid damnation.</p>
            <p>And yet by the overmaſtring power of another is thruſt into the one, and hurld into the other; which the conſciences of the moſt wicked in the world can tell them, that there is no ſuch for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing power in non-election or reprobation: Yea the non-elect Angels (which are now Devils in hell) cannot upon their non-election, charge God that either their tranſgreſſion or damnation, was invincibly inforced upon them, they indeavouring to eſcape it.</p>
            <p>Take a view of any of the men of the world, whom you much conceive may be ranked among the number of ſuch caſtawaies, and therein ſee whether the decree of reprobation had any ſuch influence upon their outward wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ked actions, that they might ſay for excuſe they were neceſſitated thereunto.</p>
            <p>The decree of reprobation did not compel or neceſſitate <hi>Cain</hi> to the murtherous act of the killing of his brother, neither was there any obligation upon <hi>Abſalom</hi> inceſtuouſly to defile his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Concubines. Neither did it unavoydably inforce <hi>Iudas</hi> to the ſelling and betraying of his Maſter; all theſe ſinful actions, and all the like committed by other the like reprobates, proceed meerly out of their own election, having a power whereby they might have abſtained from the committing of them.</p>
            <p>And therefore, my kind neighbour to help you one of this mire, that you ſink not into groſſer abſurdities, (as it is too incident to thoſe of your Tribe, who open every caſement to entertain all your new lights, though many of them prove but <hi>ignes fatui</hi>) It will be expedient to take notice of a threefold neceſſity which may have a dependency upon a ſubject perſon, and by means whereof a man may be ſaid that he muſt do ſo, and that he cannot do otherwiſe: There is a neceſſity of immutability, a neceſſity of infallibility, and a neceſſity of coaction or compulſion; I ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the terms.</p>
            <p>I call that a neceſſity of immutability, which doth befal all ſuch things as are appointed by the eternal and immutable decree
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65253:61"/>
of God, for God cannot change his counſel, but it muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity come to paſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.11. <hi>The counſel of the Lord ſtandeth for ever, and the thoughts of his heart to all generations.</hi> Mal. 3.6. <hi>I am the Lord, I change not.</hi> Secondly, neceſſity of infallibility is that whereby God doth certainly and infallibly foreſee the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turition of all things; for whereas the foreknowledge of God cannot be deceived, as reſting on an immutable decree, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatſoever he neceſſarily foreknoweth, the ſame muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily come to paſs, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.18. <hi>known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.</hi> Thirdly, neceſſity of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action or compulſion is that, wherein any patient by violence is compelled by an external agent to do this or that which otherwiſe he is unwilling to do; ſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.32. <hi>they compelled Simon to bear the croſs of Chriſt:</hi> ſo <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.23. <hi>at the great ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the gueſts are compelled to go in that the houſe might be filled:</hi> ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 26.11. <hi>Paul compelled ſome to blaſpheme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things thus premiſed, I do hence infer, that if the decree of God did produce ſuch an effect as from a proper cauſe thereof, as the continuance in ſin and unbelief, and the rejecting of the means of ſalvation, by way of coaction or compulſion, ſo that though they would they could not do otherwiſe, then well might you fall into that admiration, <hi>Where is the tender mercy of our God!</hi> But the decree of God leaves not men under ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of continuance in ſin, &amp;c. as though it either compelled men or ſollicited any unto ſinning; but thoſe that ſin, ſin as vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, and ſin is acted as freely by them, according to their own perverſe wills and deſires, as though there were no ſuch decree or foreſight of God at all.</p>
            <p>And yet it is very true that ſins do come to paſs according to the decree of God by a neceſſity, firſt of immutability, in as much as they are permitted, determined, directed and limited by the eternal decree of God, which is as himſelf immutable.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by a neceſſity of infallibility, in as much as the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of God concerning ſuch future things cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
            <p>But they do by no means come to paſs by any decree of God neceſſarily inforcing, infuſing, perſwading, or ſoliciting to ſin.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Non cuivis homini contingit adire Corinthum,</hi> all of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion are not equally capacitated to digeſt ſuch notions, and therefore <hi>Qui poteſt capere capiat,</hi> he that is able to receive it
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:65253:62"/>
let him receive it. If theſe ſpeculations be too ſublime for your thick noddle, blame not me for it.</p>
            <p>And for that portion of Scripture by you cited, it hath come under conſideration already, and hath received a full anſwer, <hi>pag.</hi> 17. to which I muſt refer the Reader; onely I ſhall adde this;</p>
            <p>That non-election or negative Reprobation doth not contract the mercy of God into ſuch ſtrait terms, but that every man in the world hath ſome ſhare in it, though not an equal ſhare.</p>
            <p>And if Gods mercy and love may be underſtood <hi>ſecundum ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectum,</hi> and not <hi>ſecundum affectum,</hi> I would have you find out any creature in the world which hath conferred ſo many and ſo great effects of mercy and love upon his young ones, as God did upon <hi>Cain, Iudas,</hi> or any other Reprobate, and then Ile give you leave to ſay that our Doctrine of Reprobation is deſtructive to the tender mercies of God.</p>
            <p>No Sir, the decree of Reprobation, as it relates to the permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſin in thoſe non-elected, argues no want at all of mercy in God, though it import a denegation of ſome mercies, even the top, and height, and bowels of his tender mercies, which God (had he been ſo pleaſed) might have beſtowed on them; but <hi>Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabiliter negatur, quod nulla ratione debetur,</hi> and with this I ſhall relax my ſhoulders from the burden of this <hi>gravamen,</hi> and ſo proceed to the next, which is but the ſecond part to the ſame tune.</p>
            <p>For thus you write, [Secondly, If God hath brought forth ſuch an effect as a continuance in ſin and unbelief &amp;c. by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree before man had any being, ſo as that the greateſt part of men muſt be eternally damned for doing but what they muſt do, and cannot, neither ever could do otherwiſe: Then where is the truth of God, who hath ſaid, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.23. <hi>Have I any pleaſure at all that the wicked ſhould die, and not that he ſhould turn from his waies and live?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if this man ſhould undertake to reſolve this queſtion, and be true to his own principles, he muſt ſay, there can be no other reaſon aſſigned for it, either of ſin or unbelief, and the rejecting of the means, but meerly the good will and pleaſure of God: But God himſelf, whoſe word I ſhall believe before this mans arguments, hath ſaid, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.32. <hi>I have no pleaſure in the death of him that dieth.</hi>

            <p>There remains therefore little elſe to be done as to this, onely to examine his texts of Scripture, wherein he inſiſts much upon ſuch expreſſions, that the Lord hath no pleaſure in the death of him that dieth, or, <hi>in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live, &amp;c.</hi> Now the mind of the Prophet in this place, is to ſtir up ſuch as had declined from God, to returne unto him by true repentance; and becauſe their iniquities were ſo many and their offences ſo great, that juſtly they might have deſpaired of remiſſion, mercy and grace, therefore doth the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet (for the better aſſuring of thoſe that ſhould repent) affirm that God delighteth not in, nor willeth the death of the wicked; but of what wicked doth the Prophet ſpeak this? Doubtleſs of ſuch wicked that truly ſhould repent; and in the death of ſuch wicked God doth not nor never will delight: But he delighteth to be known a God that ſheweth mercy, grace and favour, to ſuch as unfeignedly call for and deſire the ſame, how grievous ſoever their former offences have been: But ſuch as continue obſtinate in their impiety, have no part nor portion in theſe precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, for them will God deſtroy, and them will he thruſt by the power of his word into that fire that never ſhall be quenched. Secondly, ſuppoſe, I ſay, that the death ſpoken of here is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended no further then a temporal death, and I am ſure it is more then you are ever able to prove, that properly and directly it can be applied to eternal death, and what will that avail you then as to matter of damnation?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, tis true, God wills not the death of the wicked, with a deſire of deſtroying, or that he delights in the deſtruction, vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or perdition of ſuch creatures, neither would he it, or would effect or cauſe it if it were nothing elſe but a naked
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65253:63"/>
deſtruction or perdition: But he wills it and works it (if they do not repent) and delights in it, as it is the puniſhment of ſin, and a vindictive act of divine Juſtice, and work of God; for God hath pleaſure in all his works: The deſtruction and ruine of <hi>Babylon</hi> is called his pleaſure, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.14. <hi>he will do his pleaſure on Babylon, and his arm ſhall be on the Chaldeans:</hi> and <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.26. <hi>I will laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh:</hi> and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5.13. <hi>thus ſhall mine anger be accompliſhed, and I will cauſe my fury to reſt upon them, and I will be comforted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to this you make ſome additions, ſaying,</p>
            <p>[But now, if God have ſo diſpoſed of thoſe that live and die in ſin and unbelief, as that they never could do otherwiſe, becauſe of that decree of God which was before they had any being, then I ſay, what truth were there in all thoſe ſhowes of love that come from God in ſaying, as he liveth he delighteth not in the death of the wicked? &amp;c. were it not diſſembling, falſe dealing, and hypocriſie, as bad as can be found in the worſt of men?

            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:65253:63"/>And to what you ſay as to matter of diſſembling and Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, this is that which I ſay, that if God ſhould, as his ultimate end, by an immutable decree determine and appoint a man to ſin, or by an irreſiſtible power plunge a man into a courſe of ſinning, and in the mean time make a proteſtation, that he delights not in the death of the wicked, here you may ſay were diſſembling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
            <p>But when God hath decreed to create a man in righteouſneſs and true holineſs, and then to leave him to the liberty of his own will, though in the mean time he know, that being ſo left to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf he muſt unavoidably fall, and that he hath decreed to permit him to fall, for the manifeſtation of his juſtice, which fall will draw after it many other groſs ſins, and for which at the laſt to give him the full wages of all his unrighteouſneſs; here is no falſe dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling nor hypocriſie, though when he is ſo fallen God do require the exerting of thoſe graces wherewith he had at firſt endowed him, and which he wilfully deprived himſelf of.</p>
            <p>The confiding creditor is not to be blamed nor charged for want of pity, who having lent ſome money to his neighbour who ſpends it all and ſquanders it away in prodigality and laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if when his time of payment comes he expects a return of his money, and for want thereof caſts and debtor into priſon; He that hath wilfully made himſelf either blind or lame, who can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moan ſuch a mans condition? For thoſe expreſsions ſo obvious in the Scripture, ſetting forth Gods not delighting in the death of the wicked, it may be inferred thence, that their death and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are not things primarily well pleaſing to God; but it were ill concluded that God muſt become a hypocrite and a diſſembler if he have eternally decreed to permit them to incurre death and damnation by their own default.</p>
            <p>Gods ultimate and primary end in the non-election or Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of ſome, is mainly to raiſe glory to his great name by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his power and juſtice to be known and not that he creates a man on purpoſe to deſtroy him.

            <p>Reverend Sir, be ſerious, and tell me, who own ſuch a doctrine as teacheth that God plants brambles and ſoweth tares?

            <p>The decree of reprobation implants no evil what it finds not, but it doth onely deny to remove that evil that it doth find; God in that decree ſows no tares, but as a righteous Judge, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points the tares to be bound in bundles and caſt into the fire;

               </label> But I pray kind Sir, what would you infer from theſe places by you alledged? for you have drawn no concluſion thence, but ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend it wholly upon the readers good liking, and therefore by your good licence, I will take the boldneſs to thruſt my ſickle into your harveſt, and thence glean theſe (not inforced) conſectaries.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That here hence the doctrine of abſolute non-election or negative reprobation is ſtrongly confirmed, in that thoſe who are ſo reprobated, notwithſtanding all the outward means uſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, yet they will not, cannot believe or repent, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in their ſins.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That nothing more on Gods part could be expected either of deſert or of right, then what he had done to his vineyard: onely this, that God did do more to that part of the vineyard which he did make fruitful, then towards that part which remained barren, and that in order to, and that antecedently to its fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That ſomething more was neceſſary to the converſion of them that were not converted, it manifeſtly appears from hence, becauſe that God beyond that which was common to all, made a reſervation of ſome according to the election of grace. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.19. and 11.4, 5. <hi>viz. by taking away the vail from off their hearts,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.45. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.7. <hi>and by giving of them a new heart and a new Spirit, and writing his laws in their heart, Ier.</hi> 31.33. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.19. and 36.26, 27.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That howſoever it be taken, yet might God well demand of thoſe unprofitable and diſobedient people, what could he do more then he had done that he might make them fruitful?</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:65253:65"/>1. Becauſe he owed them no more, nor ſo much in exact juſtice, though he might have done more, of meer grace and favour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe thoſe means already uſed, were the chiefeſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of outward means.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe they had not done ſo much as by reaſon of the means they both ought and might have done.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Becauſe that none of them (herein appealing to their own conſciences) had askt any thing more of God, which he had not granted to them.</p>
            <p>And this I hope will be ſatisfactory to the ingenuous; and from hence I could willingly proceed to his exceptions againſt my third argument, and paſs a ſlur upon ſome of his frivolous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections and anſwers, wherein he doth onely <hi>verba dare,</hi> waſts time, and ſpoils clean paper with nothing but vapour and ſmoke. But becauſe it may be pretended,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.12.</note> that there was ſomething ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial in it; what wood; hay, ſtubble, I can find in it, I will bring it to the fire that it may be burnt.</p>
            <p>The firſt objection is thus languaged.</p>
            <p>[But it may be objected, that God knew that ſuch effects would follow notwithſtanding, and therefore he could not wait in expectation of better things.</p>
            <p>

               </label> My very good friend, what you ſay, as that nothing in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Reprobation did neceſſitate or was the cauſe that doth produce any ſuch effect as a continuance in ſin and unbelief, &amp;c. I yield you as to cauſe, and likewiſe to neceſſity ſo far as to co-action and compulſion; But as before I have affirmed, as it was a decree of the immutable wil of God which changeth not, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding likewiſe from his preſcience reſting on that decree; and ſo I ſay again, that it was neceſſary <hi>(neceſſitate immutabilitatis et infallibilitatis)</hi> that ſuch things would follow, notwithſtanding expectation of better things; which word <hi>expectation</hi> is uſed by the Prophet but by an anthropopathy after the manner of men, for our better apprehenſion, which ſignifies nothing elſe, but that God expects and requires from us what our debt and duty is, which yet nevertheleſs is done without any fruſtration of his end, though that be not done which he requireth of us.</p>
            <p>What you write of the means, that they were of ſuch a nature and tendency, had they not been abuſed, to bring forth thoſe good things that God ſaid he looked for, &amp;c. I grant it true in reſpect of the outward means, <hi>viz.</hi> ſoyle fruitful, place fenced, ſtones gathered, choyceſt vine planted, tower built, and a wine-preſs in it; But all theſe were but outward graces, common to all the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> alike, for there was that <hi>unum neceſſarium</hi> wanting, <hi>viz.</hi> the inward working of his holy ſpirit in their hearts by changing of their natures, and making of them new creatures, taking away their ſtony hearts, and inſtead thereof giving of them hearts of fleſh, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.19. and 26.26. without which all the other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means, though elevated to the top of <hi>Piſgah,</hi> will prove al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ineffectual.</p>
            <p>Your progreſs holds yet further after this manner.</p>
            <p>But that it doth ſometimes ſeem good in the ſight of God to hide the things concerning the kingdome of God, and the name of Jeſus, from the wiſe and prudent men of this world, according to the Scripture by him quoted out of <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.25, 26. I freely grant; as he did hide theſe things from the men of <hi>Corazin, Bethſaida</hi> and <hi>Capernaum,</hi> as a great woe unto them, or as the juſt and righteous judgement of God upon them, becauſe they repented not; for proof thereof read <hi>ver.</hi> 20. and ſo downwards, Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein moſt of his mighty

Becauſe to ſome it is ſaid that it is revealad, to others not, and that not ſo much by the preaching of the Goſpel, for that was common to them both alike, but by the inward illumination of their minds by the ſpirit of God. 2. Becauſe the diſcrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is made in the rendring of it to ſome, and hiding of it from others, is attributed to Gods ſeparating thoſe parties in the decree of election and reprobation. 3.

            </p>

            <p>Yet this I do affirm, that what you ſay, that God doth all theſe things in time as a juſt and righteous judgement: So I ſay, all theſe things did God decree that he would do, or permit to be done before all time; for there is no new Immanent act in God, but all whatſoever he in time doth, or that he doth permit others to do, thoſe very ſamethings are ſo decreed by God to be done, and likewiſe ſo decreed to be permitted to be done by others.

               </label> Grave Seignior, to what you ſay that I deduce from the Scripture, that God doth elect men in Jeſus Chriſt to eternal life without any reſpect had to faith or the uſe of means, I pray point out the place where either I or any man elſe have vented ſuch ſtuffe; if you cannot, blame me not to charge you for bearing of falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt your neighbour, yet this both my ſelf and others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly do affirm, that in the decree of election, God hath no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect at all to faith or uſe of means, as a motive, incentive, or cauſe why he ſhould elect one rather then another; but yet in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree thoſe whom he ſets his love upon to appoint them to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thoſe he doth decree that they ſhall be ſaved by faith in his Son, and by exerciſing of ſuch means as he hath or will appoint in his word.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:65253:68"/>To what you do inſert by way of conceſſion, (although they do exclude the works of the law wholly in that thing) Sir, this is your miſtake, (as I have told you of it before) For I would have you to learn this from me, if your pride be not too great, that where works of the law are excluded, and faith required, that is onely meant in the buſineſs of Juſtification, and not to be meant about the matter of election; for in the cauſe of election, both faith and uſe of means are as much excluded from having any caſting voice at all, as well as the works of the law: yet this to be underſtood excluded as antecedently to election, but not as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently excluded, as from being a means, cauſe, or motive of the decree, but yet excluded as from being of a conſequent means for the execution of the decree; for as ſo, works are as neceſſary to ſalvation as faith it ſelf, for <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. <hi>without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is there any more truth in that which follows, that we ſhould collect from that portion of Scripture, that the Reprobation of perſons to everlaſting deſtruction proceeds ſolely and ſingly from the will of God; but this is that we do affirm, that God did not elect ſome but paſt by them, and left them in their loſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and this was ſimply and ſingly from the ſame will where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he elected the reſt, and that for the ſin whereinto they had ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverably caſt themſelves, which would unavoydably fetter them, and make them obnoxious to all other ſort of ſins, for thoſe ſame ſins, I ſay, at the laſt to condeme them: and who can in this expoſtulate againſt the juſtice of God?</p>
            <p>For <hi>Iſmael, Eſau, Pharaoh,</hi> whom the Spirit of God makes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of non-election or reprobation, they were by the decree of God, which is his will or good pleaſure, left in, or paſt by in that corrupt maſs of perdition, out of which the Lord determined not to deliver them, nor to ſupply them with grace ſufficient for their ſalvation, and this was from all eternity before they were in exiſtence; concerning which our diſpute is, which as yet you do not meddle withal, but onely about reprobation in time, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which I have no cauſe to contend but ſhall readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that when theſe men came to be in being, they in their ſeveral generations were led away by their own luſts, which, as they did flow from that principle of their non-election, ſo one ſin in Gods juſtice might be the cauſe of another ſin.</p>
            <p>You make your progreſs thus.</p>
            <p>[But it is found in Scripture that Gods way in making veſſels

            <p>No Sir, Gods acts are all holy, and juſt, they were appointed to that unbelief and diſobedience, not that God would work it in them.</p>
            <p>But that he had decreed and ſo appointed to leave them in that

unbelieving and diſobedient condition whereinto man at firſt had freely precipitated himſelf, whereby he had ſo captivated all his poſterity, that they being deprived of the glory of God, and God likewiſe having decreed to permit them to fall into groſs actual tranſgreſſions, from which he was no way obliged to preſerve them; and hence it is that here it is ſaid they are appointed to it, becauſe God had decreed not to prevent it, none of this diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience or unbelief came to paſs, either God not knowing of it, or wanting power to hinder it, but God, for the ſetting forth of his own glory in the manifeſtation of his juſtice upon ſuch immori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſubjects, he had decreed to permit that unbelief and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and ſo it was appointed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Neither do we ſay that there was any precept or command, whereby God did require that unbelief or diſobedience; No, the purity of his moſt holy nature doth moſt ſeverely forbid it: but this it is that we aſſert, that the juſt God had appointed or decreed not to give them faith, which is an undeſerved grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. not to give them the ſpirit of obedience, for that is a diſobliged mercy, and yet without whoſe gift of themſelves they could do nothing, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.2. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. and that poſitively likewiſe he had decreed, that when they were refractory and diſobedient againſt the Goſpel, in a righteous way of judgement more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly to blind and harden them, ſo puniſhing ſin with ſin; and in the end and iſſue of all, to give them the wages which they had earned, that ſo they might reap what they had ſowen, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the fruits of their own labours, <hi>viz.</hi> hell and deſtruction; and ſo all of this was appointed, becauſe decreed to be done or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be done. Therefore you do but dally and play with the words, and make a mock of the language of the holy Ghoſt, when you write; If thoſe that dye in unbelief were appointed of God ſo to do, then where is their diſobedience? are they not as much obedient as thoſe that live and dye in the faith? Good Sir, this obedience that you dream of, that ſo much perplexeth your brains, ſuppoſeth a command to that unbelief, that diſobedience, which we utterly deny. Tis true this we do affirme, that there doth proceed a decree, and that, not poſitive, but negative, <hi>viz.</hi> a denyal of ſuch grace as by which they might be inabled both to believe and obey the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>And that grace being wanting to them, how ſhall they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, how can they obey? and yet all this is no other then God

               </label> Sir, in anſwer to this your concluſive cathedral gloſs, <hi>viz.</hi> that the diſobedience of unbelievers is in not doing of that which they ſhould do by the appointment of God; I muſt tell you it is very luxuriant, and corrupts the text, and perverts the whole ſcope of the Holy Ghoſt and ſenſe of the words; both of which according to the mind of the Spirit, and given in before, I need not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it.</p>
            <p>The word which the Tranſlators here render diſobedient is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, which properly ſignifies an unperſwaded perſon, an incredulous, unbelieving and refractory perſon, that wil give no aſſent unto that which he hears. And now I pray learn me one leſſon, In what Grammatical conſtruction can theſe words, whereunto they were appointed, have any manner of relation, but onely unto their antecedent diſobedient, or unbelieving, and not to any implicit command or injunction of God, as it is by you feigned.</p>
            <p>And then it muſt neceſſarily carry this Interpretation, being diſobedient, unperſwaded or incredulous, unto which their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, miſperſwaſion, or incredulity, they were before hand, even from all eternity, predetermined, predeſtinated or appointed of God.</p>
            <p>But that which followes of yours puts me into a wonder, as it was to the Jews concerning Chriſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.15. <hi>How knoweth this man Letters,</hi> or <hi>Learning?</hi> (as it is in the Margin) having never learned, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>For thoſe former tranſlations you mention, which render the words, being diſobedient to that whereon they were ſet, I have not met with any ſuch, and therefore leave them to their own ſenſe.

               </gap>: now why you ſhould tread in a path by your ſelf, and wave the beſt received Interpretation, I know no cogent reaſon for it, but that you have a vain affectati-of ſingularity. Nor indeed much would it conduce to your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, had you your deſire in this ſenſe of the word; but ſuch men as you are when they can no wayes evade the power of the Spirit ſpeaking in any Scripture, then they fall to their wrenches and turnings, and doubles, as the Hate doth when ſhe is hard hunted and in danger to be taken, and can find no other way to eſcape, and therefore I will leave you to your vain ſubterfuges; and attend to what you further ſay.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Object.</hi> But the objection that uſually is made againſt this, is grounded upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.19, 20.

ſo that they are without excuſe: <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. and hath ſhewed ſufficiently in the Scripture, that the rejecting the means of ſalvation, continuing in ſin and unbelief, is the cauſe of it, as hath been already proved, and yet I ſhall by the help and aſſiſtance of God endeavour to make it more plain; for conſider, that the people that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks to in theſe words, <hi>Thou wilt ſay unto me, why doth he yet find fault? for who hath reſiſted his will, &amp;c.</hi> were the <hi>Iews,</hi> which notwithſtanding all that God did publiſh and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto them by Jeſus Chriſt, and by his Apoſtles; firſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring unto them the choice and precious mercies of himſelf in his Son Chriſt, that repentance and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> and ſo it was declared unto them, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.10, 11, 12. <hi>that there was no other name under heaven given among men whereby they muſt be ſaved but onely by the name of Ieſus of Nazareth, whom they had crucified, whom God hath raiſed from the dead: Which is the ſtone that was ſet at nought by the builders the Iews:</hi> yea this truth was plainly declared by <hi>Paul</hi> alſo, in <hi>Acts</hi> 13. from <hi>ver.</hi> 16. to <hi>ver.</hi> 46. and he applying his ſpeech to the men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and children of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the concluſion thereof <hi>ver.</hi> 38, 39. ſaith theſe words, <hi>Be it known unto you therefore men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveneſs of ſins, and by him all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which they could not be juſtified by the law of Moſes:</hi> Beware therefore, ſaith he, <hi>ver.</hi> 40, 41. <hi>Leſt that come upon you whsch is ſpoken of in the Prophets, Behold ye deſpiſers, and wonder, and periſh, for I work a work in your dayes which ye ſhall,</hi> (or ſee <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.5.) <hi>will in no wiſe believe, though a man declare it unto you;</hi> and by this it may ſolely be concluded, that <hi>Paul</hi> was not of that mind, that thoſe people, or any other people whatſoever, were appointed, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned of God, by his purpoſe and decree from before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, that unavoidably they muſt, and can do no other but deſpiſe Jeſus Chriſt, and the means of ſalvation by him; for if he had been of that mind, then certainly he would not have bad them beware, or take heed of that which they could not help.</p>

And that which he ſaith <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>Iacob have I loved, but Eſau have I hated,</hi> was written by the Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> many years after they were born, brought forth and became two nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as it was ſaid to <hi>Rebecca, Gen.</hi> 25.23. and the ground or reaſon ſhewed by <hi>Obadiah, ver.</hi> 10. and this is to ſhew that God hath not bound himſelf by any purpoſe, decree, or promiſe, to elect, juſtifie, or eternally to ſave them by their keeping the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and in being the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the fleſh, and therefore there could be no unrighteouſneſs with God in caſting them out, or breaking them off from their own Olive-tree, notwithſtanding all that they could plead for themſelves in theſe things.</p>
            <p>But it was that vain confidence that <hi>Paul</hi> knew they had in theſe things before mentioned in <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Behold, thou art called a Iew, and reſteſt in the law and art confident, &amp;c.</hi> and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> might well ſay, <hi>thou Iew that reſteſt in the law and art confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> wilt ſay unto me, <hi>Why doth he yet find fault? for who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſisted
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:65253:73"/>
his will?</hi> for being ſo confident in theſe things, they would be apt to ſay, Why ſhould God find fault with us? Is it not the will of God that the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> being circumciſed, and keeping the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſhould be his people? and hath not God himſelf commanded theſe things, and annexed promiſes thereunto? who hath reſiſted his will in all this? But <hi>Paul</hi> having before fully proved, that God had not bound himſelf either by purpoſe, decree, or promiſe, to elect, juſtifie, or eternally to ſave them upon that account, might well ſay, thou muſt not reply againſt God, for he having made no ſuch promiſes unto thee upon thoſe terms, he is at liberty to break thee off as an unfruitful branch, and to make of thee a veſſel of diſhonour.</p>
            <p>For notwithſtanding all the means that God had uſed towards them in order to their converſion, they having all heard <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.18. and God having ſtretched forth his hands unto them all the day long, and yet, notwithſtanding all that God had done for them in tendring unto them ſuch precious promiſes in Jeſus Chriſt, yet they were a diſobedient and gain-ſaying people: and thus walking ſtubbornly againſt God all the day of Grace, they are now in the hands of God as the clay was in the hand of the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to make of them veſſels of diſhonour: for the Potter did not take a piece of clay into his hand on purpoſe to make ſuch a veſſel at the firſt as it was made by him afterwards; but <hi>Ier.</hi> 18.4. <hi>the veſſel which he made of clay was marred in the hand of the Potter, and ſo he made it again another veſſel, as it ſeemed good unto the Potter to make it:</hi> and ſo in like manner, thoſe people, the Jews that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> being ſtubborn in the hands of God, and diſobedient unto his righteouſneſs, even when his hand was ſtretched forth unto them all the day long, it was now juſt with God to make of them veſſells of wrath, fitted, or made up for deſtruction; and thus it is plain to any rational man, that will but look on theſe things with a ſingle eye, and with an upright mind judge of the ſame, that the good will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God is not ſolely and ſingly the cauſe of Reprobation, without having any other ground or reaſon aſsigned thereunto in Scripture; but that the rejecting the means of ſalvation, to wit, the free tenders of Chriſt in the Goſpel, continuing in ſin and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, and denying the power of godlineſs, is aſsigned by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit in the Scripture as a cauſe thereof.]</p>
            <p>And as God thus dealt with the Jews, becauſe they ſought not
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:65253:73"/>
righteouſneſs by faith in Chriſt, ſo doth God in like manner deal with all the world for the like cauſe: <hi>He that believeth not is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already, becauſe he hath not believed in the name of the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Son of God: and this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkneſs rather then light, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their deeds are evil:</hi> and 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12. <hi>Becauſe they received not the love of the truth that they might be ſaved, and for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them strong deluſions, that they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a lye, that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs.</hi>]</p>

            <p>But my purpoſe is to keep me cloſe to the words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, who beſt knew the meaning of the Spirit, and who alone is ſufficient to be his own interpreter, and from thence to infer ſo much as to a rational man may give a full deciſion to the matter in controverſie, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſin and unbelief is not the cauſe of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation before all time, but that it proceeds ſolely from the good pleaſure of Gods moſt holy will, to reprobate or paſs by whom he pleaſeth; though this confident I might ſay impudent man, ſaith he, hath already proved the contrary: But ſure then it muſt be in one of his former printed volumes, I am certain it cannot be found in this pamphlet.</p>

Your skill in Chorography it ſeems is not ordinary, ſuch a dull brain as I have, did believe that <hi>Rome</hi> ſtood in <hi>Italy,</hi> within the bounds of <hi>Europe,</hi> but your dextrous art hath eſpied it out in <hi>Iudea</hi> within the climates of <hi>Aſia,</hi> many hundreds of miles diſtant from what I ever apprehended of it.

            </p>
            <p>For truly Sir, I muſt tell you, that you muſt help me to ſuch a faith that can remove mountains in the twinkling of an eye, nay cities too, before I can yield to you that <hi>Paul</hi> here ſpeaks to the Jews: For if I may ſafely believe <hi>Paul</hi> rather then you, it was directed to the <hi>Romans, Rom.</hi> 1.7. for all that be in <hi>Rome;</hi> and the Poſtſcript written to the <hi>Romans</hi> from <hi>Corinthus.</hi> Now who can be ſo ignorant as not to know that the <hi>Romans</hi> were Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles and not Jews? and though in this chapter mention be made of the Jews, his ſorrow for them in reſpect of his near relation to them, their ancient pedigree and great priviledges, yet it is directed particularly to the Gentiles, that they might make a holy uſe thereof. So that your fabrick raiſed on ſo ſandy a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, your <hi>Babel</hi> conſiſting of a bare circumlocution of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral texts of Scripture forced by you to ſpeak what was never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Holy Ghoſt in them, it all moulders to powder. But leſt this may ſeem rather a tergiverſation then an anſwer, I will, as I intended, offer to the Readers view, the genuine Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſis of the Apoſtle in this part of the chapter, that ſo ſorting it as collateral to your forced interpretation, the judicious Reader may thereby cenſure, whether is more ſuitable to the mind of the Holy Ghoſt, yours or mine.</p>
            <p>In the former part of this chapter, the Apoſtle had been treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the predeſtination of the Saints by the examples of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and now is he entred upon the doctrine of reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the examples of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> under which all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates may be comprehended: Of whom when he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:65253:74"/>
that it was not for any of their evil deeds, but the meet good pleaſure of Gods will that ſo rejected them: and having propoſed an objection to himſelf, which carnal wiſdome might alledge, that if the matter were ſo, then there was unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with God, to deal ſo unequally with perſons that were in all things in an equal condition.</p>
            <p>He repulſeth this objection as moſt abſurd, ſaying, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid; and withal he aggravates his proteſtation againſt ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion as the charging of God with injuſtice, by the teſtimony of God to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 33.9. <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, &amp;c.</hi> the reaſon whereof is drawn from Gods abſolute and moſt free power that he hath over all his creatures to do with them what he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>The ſame abſolute ſovereignty is likewiſe ratified by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> in whom there is ſuch a ſeries and concate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of acts of the divine providence in hardening and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying, and that written in ſuch large Characters, that all the future ages of the world might know, that God is Lord Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount over all the works of the creation, and therefore that he may, when, and whom, and where he pleaſeth, raiſe up ſome to be as potſheards, that were made of purpoſe that his abſolute power might be ſhewen on them; as to ſhew mercy on whom he will, ſo to harden whom he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>This block being removed, and thereby the point of abſolute ſoveraignty being confirmed, the Apoſtle now meets with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther objection, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>Thou wilt ſay unto me, why doth he yet find fault? for who hath reſisted his will?</hi> now from what the Apoſtle here objects, it is palpable that in himſelf he concludes, that it depends meerly on the will of God that ſome are Reprobated, or not elected, and thereby hardened, and being hardened do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably ſin and periſh. For humane reaſon from what was ſaid <hi>(whom he will he hardens)</hi> might conclude, that the Apoſtles doctrine leads to an abſurdity; for if it muſt be ſo, how can it be that God can juſtly complain of thoſe which are hardened, and ſo of thoſe who are Reprobated, when they do ſin? How may it be ſaid can God complain? and that for a double reaſon: Firſt, becauſe thoſe who are hardened or reprobated, when they ſin, they do onely ſuch things as God doth will to permit by them to be done. Secondly, becauſe thoſe who are ſo reprobated and hardened, they can do no other then thus ſin, if that unto that purpoſe they
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:65253:75"/>
were ſo hardened and reprobated: Now both of theſe things are very true, neither doth the Apoſtle deny either of them. But that which humane reaſon doth infer from thence, <hi>viz.</hi> that therefore God cannot in juſtice find fault, or be angry with the Reprobates when they ſin, this he takes for a falſe concluſion, and therefore he checks the boldneſs and petulancy of wanton carnal reaſon, ſaying, <hi>Nay but O man, who art thou that replieſt againſt God?</hi> wherein the Apoſtle flatly condemns the daring boldneſs of ſuch men, who when God had plainly declared in his word, that according to his free good will and pleaſure, he had elected whom he would, and therewith had mercy on whom he would, and that he had likewiſe not elected or reprobated, and therewith hardened more and more whom he world, yet they would be ſo adventurous as to reply, anſwer again, diſpute, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulate the caſe with God, thereby tacitly accuſing him of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, and making him either the author or approver of ſin, and ſo extenuating their own wickedneſs. In ſhort, it tends thus far to our purpoſe, that the Apoſtle inſiſts not on a refutation of theſe reaſons, but by his ſilence gives conſent unto them, onely he rejects the ſequel thence deduced, by this expreſs reproof, <hi>who art thou that replieſt againſt God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next, for a further confirmation of what he hath in hand, he brings a ſimilitude from the Potters houſe: <hi>Shall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, why hast thou made me thus?</hi> In which words are condemned the deſperate audaciouſneſs of ſuch, who fear not to contend with God their maker, why he had not made them otherwiſe then he hath: a like parallel place we have, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 45.9. <hi>Wo unto him that striveth with his maker, let the potſheard strive with the potſheards of the earth; ſhall the clay ſay to him that faſhioneth it, what makest thou?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, in theſe words, <hi>Hath not the potter power? &amp;c.</hi> the Apoſtle by an argument <hi>a minori ad majus,</hi> clearly evinceth, that God may, without the leaſt tincture of unrighteouſneſs, elect or reprobate, have mercy or harden, appoint to ſalvation or damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whom he will.</p>
            <p>For if the potter may enjoy that freedom without the control of any, that of the ſame lump of clay he may make one veſſel to honour and another to diſhonour, how much more may God, who is ſuch a Lord that no man may ſay unto him,<note place="margin">Job. 9.12.</note> 
               <hi>What doest thou?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:65253:75"/>Adde moreover this (to make it weigh heavier) the potter, though he be the maker of the veſſel, yet he is not the maker of the clay whereof the veſſel is made; but God he made us of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, at leaſt he made the lump of clay whereof man was made: Now the Apoſtle purpoſely made uſe of the word clay, to prevent a cavil which might be made, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is a great deal of difference betwixt us and earthen veſſels: be it ſo; but yet what are we but as clay in the hands of God? for thereof were we at firſt formed, ſo <hi>Ier.</hi> 18.6.</p>
            <p>And therefore without diſpute, we are more properly as clay in the hands of God, then the clay whereof the veſſel is made, in the hands of the potter. And that the Lord hath a far greater power over us, then the potter hath over his clay, becauſe we are more properly Gods, then the clay is the potters, for the pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter made not the clay, but God made both the clay and the pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; he made the clay of nothing, and of that clay faſhioned man: Beſides, the potter as he made not the clay, ſo is it not in his power to unmake it, but that it will be clay ſtill; but God, as he formed man of nothing, ſo if he would pleaſe he might reduce us to our firſt nothing. Moreover, we ſee that there is a great difference between the potter and his pot that he makes, and yet it is but finite, for both are creatures: But between God the creatot of all, and us his creatures, there is an infinite diſproportion, ſo that hence it comes to paſs, that the power and ſoveraignty that God hath over the work of his hands, is infinitely beyond what the potter hath over his clay. If therefore the potter hath ſuch power over his clay that is not ſimply his own, but holding all in <hi>capite</hi> from God himſelf, how much greater power then hath God over us <hi>worms and no men</hi> to frame, faſhion, and do with us what ſeems good in his own eyes, without any diſpute to be made with him?</p>
            <p>From all which it is as clear as the day, that God in Reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or non-election, though he had no reſpect to ſin as to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, yet in reſpect of the ſoveraignty that he hath over his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he may according to his good will and pleaſure, form and appoint any veſſel to diſhonour, without being accountable to any, or in the leaſt meaſure charged of unrighteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>And thus having done with my Antagoniſt, for his doctrinal part out of that ninth chapter of the <hi>Romans,</hi> I muſt attend unto the practical uſes that he draws from them, which are theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:65253:76"/>[Now the uſe that we make of this, is firſt, it doth hereby ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that Gods decree before the foundation of the world, doth not hinder men from being eternally ſaved, if they be not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to themſelves in the uſe of that means, and the exerciſe of that power that God giveth unto them for the accompliſhing of their everlaſting happineſs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It may be a precious incouragement to all people to go unto God by Jeſus Chriſt, in the uſe of that means that he hath appointed, for life and ſalvation, foraſmuch as he is able to ſave to the uttermoſt all that come unto God by him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, thoſe that have embraced Jeſus Chriſt by that way and means, may be ſweetly comforted in the everlaſting love of the Father, manifeſted to their ſouls through the precious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God in Chriſt Jeſus, which are not yea and nay, but in him they are yea and amen; which promiſes of remiſſion of ſins, the everlaſting inheritance, and the holy Spirit of promiſe, as <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1.13, 14. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. a ſeal or earneſt of the ſame inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and thoſe promiſes are aſſigned, and made over ſo firmly to penitent believers, being baptized in the name of the Lord Jeſus, together with ſeeking for the ſame ſpirit by prayer, and laying on of hands, believing the reſurrection of the dead, and the eternal judgement, and growing up, upon thoſe principles, in holineſs of life, in the fear of God, and with a ſingle heart in obedience to Chriſt, delighting to obſerve all his counſel, and ſo going on unto perfection in the way of righteouſneſs, with perſeverance endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring therein to the end of their lives, that they ſhall undoubtedly be ſaved in the day of the Lord; according to theſe, and ſuch like Scriptures, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.15, 16. <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.16. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.14.

            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, let the expreſs words of Jeſus Chriſt be accepted of

               </gap>d of anſwering any one of yours, I ſhall deduce from the doctrine that I have delivered certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſectaries, flowing from the breaſts of conſolation,<note place="margin">Iſa. 66.11.</note> and naturally ariſing from the ſubſequent words of the Apoſtle, which may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce much (if well applied) to the buſineſs now in controverſie between us.</p>
            <p>Firſt, here we may behold as in a glaſs the hatred of God againſt ſin, and for the ſake thereof againſt ſinners, <hi>viz.</hi> that whiles we ſee him by his vindictive juſtice executing of wrath upon ſinners, he hereby declares himſelf to be a God hating ſin, neither that any iniquity can dwell with him;<note place="margin">Pſal. 5.4.</note> And as his anger is extended againſt ſin, ſo it is onely againſt ſin; ſin is none of Gods creatures, no part of the creation, for all that he made was good: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God is not angry with, nor hates the devil intenſively, and that immediately as to his perſon and nature, for that is good; but as he hath contracted ſin, and ſo that renders him hateful and abominable. How then can God be charged with any ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, when he is pleaſed for the manifeſtation of his juſtice, and therein of his hatred unto ſin, he is pleaſed I ſay, not to elect, but to reprobate ſome, and fits them, makes them up, or appoints them to deſtruction, that all the world may ring of his anger and hatred againſt ſin?</p>
            <p>Secondly, and as God was willing to ſhew his wrath, ſo was it needfull there ſhould be ſuch ſubjects, even the Reprobates, on whom he might make his power known, that whiles we look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, <hi>avenging himſelf on his enemies,</hi> the Reprobates,<note place="margin">Iſa. 1.24.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhews us his wrath againſt their ſin, ſo withal we might take
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:65253:77"/>
notice of his power,<note place="margin">Pſal. 2.9.</note> 
               <hi>that he may break them with a rod of Iron, and daſh them in pieces like a potters veſſel,</hi> and that onely becauſe of their ſin;<note place="margin">Pſa. 2.11.</note> and that we might hence learn <hi>to ſerve the Lord with fear, and rejoyce with trembling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, this may likewiſe ſerve as a watch-tower, or warning-piece to the elect, that when as they ſee how infinite the anger of God is againſt ſin, and how full of power he is to take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance for ſin,<note place="margin">Jude 23.</note> they might thence be provoked to hate the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſpotted with the fleſh, and alwayes ſtand in awe and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the moſt mighty God,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.29.</note> whoſe wrath is like a conſuming fire: And therefore it is not ſaid, what if God willing to be angry and to put forth his power as though that God were delighted in anger, and in the acting of ſuch a power, and therefore to this end did not elect or Reprobate ſuch a multitude of men.</p>
            <p>But it is ſaid, What if God willing to ſhew his wrath, and make his power known? <hi>viz.</hi> to all the men in the world, in all ages and generations, to the Reprobate, that they thence may be made inexcuſable.</p>
            <p>But to the elect, that they having in their eye ſo many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Gods wrath and power upon the reprobrates for their ſins, they might thereby be ſtirred up to ſerve God acceptably with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and godly fear,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.28. Phil. 2.12.</note> ſo working out their ſalvation with fear and trembling.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, this will ſerve as a <hi>Mercuries</hi> finger to point unto the honour of the Saints, and to ſet forth the high advancement that from all eternity they have had in the boſome of God, <hi>viz.</hi> that God could be well pleaſed that a greater part of the ſons of men ſhould be paſſed by as not known of God,<note place="margin">Pro. 8.31.</note> and ſo left to the original hardneſs of their own hearts, which <hi>Adam</hi> voluntarily drew upon himſelf and all his poſterity, and for which to be doomed to everlaſting torments, to this end among the reſt, that he might make known the riches of his glory on the veſſels of mercy;<note place="margin">Rom. 9.23</note> 
               <hi>contraria juxta ſe poſita mutuo ſe illustrant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how are the riches of his glory made known to the Saints by the reprobating of ſome? Why herein it is manifeſted, that when as there was an equality of condition in all, all alike lookt upon as in one corrupt lump and maſs of perdition, wherein it was in the free power and holy liberty of God, to have reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thoſe whom he hath elected, and to have elected thoſe whom he hath reprobated from eternity,<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5.9.</note> 
               <hi>Yet he hath not appointed us unto
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65253:77"/>
wrath, but to obtain ſalvation by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> all which doth proceed from the riches of his glory, and no foreſeen worth, or works, or faith in us.</p>
            <p>And now worthy Sir, by comparing of your Enthuſiaſms with my Analyſis and practical uſes thereupon, let the impartial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der judge, whether hath more candidly repreſented the ſcope, ſenſe and mind of the holy Ghoſt, you or I.</p>
            <p>So that now after this tedious conflict for the defence of my ſecond Argument, I muſt attend your ſummons to ſee what you can ſay againſt my third Argument, which followeth.</p>
            <p>[His third Argument is this; If ſin and unbelief, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting of the means of ſalvation, are the onely cauſes why God reprobates any to deſtruction, then there is no ſuch myſtery in the decree of reprobation, neither are Gods wayes therein ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable, but that the true and undoubted cauſe may be aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But yet they are myſterious and unſearchable. See (ſaith he) <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.14. <hi>What ſhall we ſay then, is there unrighteouſneſs with God? God forbid, Rom.</hi> 11.33, 34. <hi>O the depth of the riches of the wiſdom and knowledge of God! how unſearchable are his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his wayes paſt finding out? for who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been his counſellour?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer; firſt, that had I not been acquainted with the blindneſs of theſe men, that love to be called of men, <hi>Rabbi,</hi> or Maſter, I ſhould have been taken up with admiration, that one boaſting ſo much of ſchollarſhip, ſhould make a parcel of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments directly againſt the truth, and yet ſhould appear no better the one with the other.</p>
            <p>In this firſt Argument, in anſwer to this Poſition, he giveth out as if the will of God were ſolely and ſingly the cauſe of reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that no other cauſe can be aſsigned for it, either of ſin, unbelief, or rejecting the means, but the meer good pleaſure of Gods moſt holy and righteous will, as in the preamble to his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and in the minor propoſition of the Argument it ſelf, he ſaith, the Scripture aſſignes Reprobation ſolely to Gods will; and yet in this third Argument, he ſtrongly calleth in queſtion the truth of all this, in giving out as if the true and undoubted cauſe cannot be aſſigned, or as if that which ſolely &amp; ſingly was the cauſe of Reprobation, were not the true and undoubted cauſe of it: what a piece of confuſed ſtuff is this, let them that have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding judge.]</p>

               </label> Truly I do not malice, but rather pity this ſimple ſophiſter, who doth <hi>Nodum in ſcripo querere,</hi> peeps about for contradictions in my Arguments; whereas if a man be not blinded through pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice he ſhall find a moſt harmonious concord.</p>
            <p>Sir, I willingly paſs by your ſcandalous Ironies of blindneſs, <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi,</hi> Maſter, boaſting of ſcholarſhip, as unworthy of a return; but I now tell you, tis very true that in my firſt Argument, and ſo indeed al along, I do aſcribe non-election or Reprobation ſolely and ſingly to the meer good pleaſure of Gods moſt holy and righteous will.</p>
            <p>But I pray Sir, make it to appear how in this third Argument I do trip up the heels of my former Argument, calling into queſtion the truth of all this, as though the true and undoubted cauſe could not be aſſigned, or that the will of God were not ſolely and ſingly the cauſe of Reprobation. Curious Sir, learn this from me, that he that doth exclude all outward cauſes as to Reprobation, which are tranſient and in time are acted in and by the creature, doth not thereby exclude all inward cauſes, which are immanent, immutable, and eternal, reſting in the boſome and breaſt of God himſelf, which we call his will and good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: now the firſt we deny, this later we affirm to be the alone cauſe of Reprobation.</p>
            <p>That which makes the decree of non-election or Reprobation to be myſterious, and unſearchable, is not becauſe there is no cauſe of it at all, for I have affirmed the will of God to be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and eternal cauſe thereof; but this is that for which the Apoſtle calls it myſterious, becauſe that no external cauſe can be aſſigned, but that the further that men out of curioſity, or rather deſperate boldneſs have attempted to find out an external cauſe, the more they have entangled themſelves, and the more have they intrencht upon the holy majeſty of God. And therefo e where in all the holy Scripture, the Spirit of God hath not a tongue to ſpeak of any ſuch external cauſe or cauſes of eternal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, there muſt not Gods people have an ear to hear, but in defect of an external cauſe, to aſcribe all to the internal, <hi>viz.</hi> the good will and pleaſure of God himſelf,<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 1.7. 1 Cor. 13.12. Phil. 3.15.</note> who hath no otherwiſe been pleaſed in his revealed word to give any other account un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us of ſuch his actings, beſides his own will. <hi>But when the Lord Ieſus ſhall be revealed, and that we do behold him face to face,</hi> this which now is unto us a myſtery, and unſearchable by reaſon
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:65253:78"/>

But you proceed further;</p>
            <p n="3">[3.

            <p>But I have followed him a litle in owning his expreſſions, as far as they will ſtand with the truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that rejecting the means of ſalvation, continuing in ſin and unbelief, are in ſome meaſure the cauſe of Reprobation, and through the good hand of my God upon me, have proved it by Scripture. And notwithſtanding this man hath ſo ſtrongly oppoſed it in his two firſt Arguments, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this poſition, yet one would think by what he ſaith in this third Argument, that he were a little inclinable to be of my mind, or otherwiſe why doth he uſe thoſe words (the onely cauſe) if he do not in ſome meaſure grant theſe things to be a cauſe of Reprobation?]</p>

But Sir, are you onely a ſtranger in Jeruſalem, and know not theſe things? or have you not learnt to diſtinguiſh between the habit of faith, and the act of faith?</p>
            <p>I know a regenerate perſon when he ſleeps hath the habit of faith, though at that time he want the act and uſe of faith: A convert likewiſe under a ſpiritual deſertion, may have the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and ſeed of faith, and yet want an active and an operating faith: And ſo an elect Infant, though in reſpect of the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of its natural faculties, he is indiſpoſed actually to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, yet in regard he is a ſubject capable of the inward workings of the Spirit of God to ſanctifie his corrupt nature, he may paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively receive the grace of ſanctification, and therewith the habit, root, ſeed or principle of faith, and from thence to be denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated a believer.</p>
            <p>Infants are reputed in the number of reaſonable creatures, yea even before they have the act or uſe of reaſon, onely becauſe they have it <hi>in ſemine,</hi> in the ſeed or root of reaſon; and why not alike to have faith in the habit, or root, and ſo reputed for believers, though they cannot actually exert it?<note place="margin">Phil. 19</note> Sir, I muſt tell you, firſt, that faith is infuſed, not acquired; tis given to believe, which paſſively infants are in a capacity of, as well as thoſe that are adult. 2.

            <p>In anſwer to this rabble, I ſay, that as there is ſalvation for all ſorts and degrees of perſons of age in covenant, but not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to all of thoſe ſorts and degrees, to reach every individual perſon; ſo in a parallel way we may think of infants, I know no Text giving us univerſal aſſurance of their happineſs; in caſe there were, and that all this that you have ſaid were truth, I ſuppoſe there were much more cauſe for believers to beg of God their infants death, then with <hi>David</hi> in prayer to ſeek their life: there being (as you ſay) full aſſurance of their happineſs dying, and ſo much fear of their condemnation, living, to ſee the temptations to which in their growth they are ſubject. Nay, if no child dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in infancy ſhall ever be caſt into the lake of fire, what ſhould then deny but that it ſhould be enrolled in the Chronicles as the mercifulleſt act that <hi>Herod</hi> ever did in all his life,<note place="margin">Mat. 2.16.</note> 
               <hi>when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that all the male children in Bethlehem from two years old and under ſhould be murthered?</hi> for had they live to ripe years, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably they would <hi>have filled up the meaſure of their fathers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 23.32.</note> and contributed as much, and had their hands dipt as deep in the blood of Chriſt as any other of their brethren; and therefore <hi>Herod</hi> to be as a bleſſed memorable butcherous murtherer, that ſent ſo many poor ſouls as Martyrs to heaven, by the ſleight of hand, who had been like never to come thither, had it not been for his merciful cruelty.</p>
            <p>Yea, you your ſelf might be regiſtred as the moſt indulgent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who for the ſaving of the ſouls of your children, would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your own to loſs, by cutting of your childrens throats as ſoon as they were born, and ſo poſting of them to heaven before their due time; whereas perhaps if they had lived ſo long, as with their mothers milk to have ſuckt in the venome of your principles and poſitions, they might have endangered both body and ſoul
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:65253:83"/>
from ever coming thither.</p>
            <p>But what horrible things are theſe to think of, I am amazed to write it; and yet conſectaries that without any inforcement might very well flow from your poſitions, <hi>viz.</hi> that no child dying in infancy before they come to have a being to act, ſhall ever be caſt into the lake of fire, <hi>which is the ſecond death.</hi> Whereas we do affirm, that children as well as others, being the objective ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Predeſtination, and ſo conſidered as in the corrupt lump and maſs of perdition, with the reſt of all the poſterity and brood of old <hi>Adam,</hi> according to the eternal and immutable decree, proceeding from the ſole good pleaſure of Gods moſt holy will,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25.29.</note> the ſouls of ſome of them <hi>are bound up in the bundle of life with the Lord their God;</hi> and the ſouls of the reſt, being paſt over, or not elected, <hi>they ſhall be flung out as out of the middle of a ſling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet for confirmation of what you here aſſert, you do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour <hi>cum ratione inſanire,</hi> to have ſome reaſon for this your wild aſſertion; and next, you baſely proſtitute the pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled word of God to fortifie your firſt: I ſhall undertake them both in their order, and by Gods aſſiſtance ſhall firſt preſcribe you a pill to purge this your melancholy frenzy, and next ſhall reſcue thoſe Scriptures by you alledged, out of your hands, giving them to ſpeak in that peculiar ſenſe they were at firſt intended by the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>And firſt, my learned Antagoniſt, had you placed the ground of your hope diſtributively, <hi>viz.</hi> upon the children of believers, you might have had ſome foundation for it, becauſe the promiſe of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant doth no leſs appertain to Infants, then to thoſe of ripe years; <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. <hi>I will be a God to thee and to thy ſeed.</hi> The promiſe is <hi>to you and to your children, Acts</hi> 2.39.<note place="margin">Acts 2.39.</note> But whereas you take it collectively, and univerſally, including therein the children of Turks, Jews, Pagans, Infidels, you have neither rule nor word, nor promiſe for any ſuch hope, that they ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>And now the firſt reaſon that you produce for your Infantiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimous aſſertion, that no child in infancy ſhall ever be caſt into the lake of fire, is, Becauſe they not having the uſe of thoſe faculties, as hearing, together with the uſe of reaſon to underſtand what is ſpoken, and being not capable of any embracing of the means, and which never had a being to act, therefore they cannot reject the means of ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Sir, for this time admit it ſo, that children cannot hear nor
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:65253:84"/>
have not the uſe of reaſon; Sir, neither can thoſe that are born deaf, nor Ideots, nor madmen; in what ſtate or rank will you then place them?</p>
            <p>And for the rejecting of the means of ſalvation, neither can they that never enjoyed the means reject it, and in what ſquadron will you place them?</p>
            <p>And therefore this aſſertion of yours is grounded on a falſe ſuppoſition, that God cannot, or at leaſt he will not, or doth not regenerate, without the word heard, underſtood, and embraced: but good Sir, I muſt tell you that what expreſſions are uſed in Scripture, as neceſſarily requiring the hearing of the word, and receiving of the means, it ſpeaks of to ſuch as are in a capacity ſo to hear it and receive it, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe of ripe years and rationaliſts; and where the Scripture is ſilent, <hi>viz.</hi> as to children, deaf, or fools, do not you undertake to determine without Gods advice and counſel, but leave all the work, as I do, to Gods ſecret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of predeſtination, wherein he may do with his own what his good will and pleaſure is, either to ſave, or to damn, without the control of any.</p>
            <p>And though we in a charitable way may hope the beſt of all thoſe children that are born within the compaſs of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>viz.</hi> of believing parents, yet how God is pleaſed to bring his purpoſe to paſs, in the ſaving of any one of them, is to me, and ſober-minded men, as inſcrutable, as is the faſhioning of their tender bodies in their mothers wombs; and it is enough to me that we may hope well of them, becauſe God by his promiſe hath ingaged himſelf (wherein he cannot lye,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. Tit. 1.2.</note> nor deny himſelf) to be a God in covenant not with us onely, but with our children like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: and were it not upon the account of the decree of election (which is the foundation of all the promiſe) <hi>wherein God hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardens,</hi> and that, not for any thing of good, either done or foreſeen, but meerly out of his own good pleaſure, we ſhould have juſt cauſe to doubt, that all children dying in infancy ſhould unavoidably be damned.</p>
            <p>Beſides, my good friend, have you yet learnt, or do you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what it is that doth regenerate? If you aſcribe this work to the word heard (as it ſeems you do) you are mainly miſtaken;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.6</note> The word of it ſelf is but a <hi>dead Letter,</hi> at beſt it is but a moral inſtrument, and therefore it can never operate, unleſs it be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65253:84"/>
which can never he by one that is as yet unregenerate,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.14.</note> 
               <hi>for the natural man receiveth not the things of the ſpirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him: neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No Sir, it is the peculiar work of the Spirit to regenerate and convert: <hi>Lydia's</hi> heart was opened,<note place="margin">Acts 16. Mat. 13.3. Rom. 1.16.</note> before ſhe ſo diligently atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to <hi>Pauls</hi> words. The word of God that brought forth fruit, did not make the ground good, but it was ſo before by the ſpecial working of that Spirit: <hi>The word, which is the power of God to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> doth not make believers, but God firſt makes them ſo by ſanctifying of their natures and giving them to believe.<note place="margin">Phil. 1.29.</note> The word of God in Regeneration hath no greater force or power then the word of the Prophets and Apoſtles had in raiſing of the dead, which had no other operation then to be <hi>tanquam ſignum,</hi> as a ſign of the thing done, or as a moral inſtrument; for there is no leſſer power requirable in the recovery of a poor ſoul from a ſpiritual death to a ſpiritual life, then there is from a natural death to a natural life: And therefore as it is Gods peculiar, to raiſe from death to life natural; ſo it is his alone prerogative, to raiſe from a ſpiritual death to a ſpiritual life, <hi>The dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall live, Ioh.</hi> 5.25.</p>
            <p>Yea, the ſame power is exerted in the work of Regeneration or the new creation, as was at firſt in the work of the old creation;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.6.</note> no leſs then an hand of omnipotency in them both, and therefore not communicable to any creature.</p>
            <p>From all of which I ſhall hence infer, that if it be Gods peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar work to regenerate, and not the word in the hearing of it, and that Regeneration is principally neceſſary to give us ingreſs into heaven,<note place="margin">Joh. 3.3. Mat. 5.8.</note> God may then as well regenerate infants by his ſecret power unſearchable to us, though they neither hear nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, as he doth thoſe that are of riper years, by ſo weak an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument as the word and Goſpel is, which hath no ſuch inherent power in and of it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this your aſſertion labours of another ſickneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> a falſe ſuppoſition, that nothing but actual ſins expoſe men to the danger of being caſt into the lake of fire, whereas the truth is, That original ſin or that hereditary pravity we brought with us into the world, deriving it from our parents,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.5.</note> 
               <hi>who conceived us in ſin,</hi> hath ſo much of filthineſs and uncleanneſs in it, that God may juſtly caſt a new-born infant into the lake of fire for it, unleſs
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:65253:85"/>
it be waſhed clean by the blood of Jeſus, who is the alone way, <hi>the truth &amp; the life,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 14.6.</note> and through whoſe alone merits we have an acceſs into the <hi>Holy of Holies;</hi> into which place are admitted onely theſe whoſe names are written in the Lambs book of life,<note place="margin">Rev. 21.27. Luke 10.20. Rev. 20.15.</note> 
               <hi>whoſe names are written in heaven;</hi> regiſtred there in the eternal immutable decree of Gods election unto life: all the reſt whoſe names are not there recorded, infants as well as others, are caſt into the lake of fire, <hi>which is the ſecond death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But enough of this at preſent; I ſhall be ſure to meet you again more about this, when you lay out your ſtrength againſt original ſinne.</p>
            <p>Another thing which you give out in the nature of a reaſon why infants cannot be damned, is, <hi>viz.</hi> for that their not having of faith will never be charged upon them as ſin. Sir, ſuppoſe I grant ſo much; and ſo likewiſe what you produce out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.15. as a confirmation, or rather as a reaſon of your reaſon, <hi>for where no law is there is no tranſgreſſion,</hi> both may be very true, as ſet diſjunctively; but as you have woven them both into one ſentence, they may not be true, nor applicable to your purpoſe, for herein you vary your terms; that which you write takes notice of ſin, the text ſpeaks of tranſgreſſion, wherein, I conceive, ſin and tranſgreſſion are not terms convertible: for though every tranſgreſſion of the law be a ſin, yet every ſin is not a tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the law, as in the caſe now before us; for original ſin, though it be a ſin properly and really, yet it is not a tranſgreſſion of the law as perſonally acted in and by the infants, but as impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively, and as a defect of original righteouſneſs. So what you further ſay by way of illuſtration, that there can be no law to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, as ſuch, and ſin is not imputed where there is no law, I grant you, as to infants now in exiſtence, which law might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the exerting, or putting out of any act or duty which their minority is uncapable to receive, or to perform: But I muſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all tell you, that as <hi>Adam,</hi> as a publick perſon, as a root, and ſtock, received Grace, righteouſneſs and holineſs for him and his, even for thoſe in his loins; ſo he received a law to him and his, even the Covenant of works, <hi>do this and live;</hi> which law was incumbent not onely on <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf, but likewiſe on all thoſe that were in his loins. So that infants now are born under a law, and their want of original righteouſneſs, and (that for the defect thereof) their being conceived and born in ſin and uncleanneſs, ſhall be a
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:65253:85"/>
deſerving cauſe of their juſt condemnation.</p>
            <p>What you bring forth in evidence to what you here aim at, <hi>viz. Rom.</hi> 5.13. <hi>ſin is not imputed where there is no law,</hi> is ſo far from anſwering your deſire, that it cuts the throat of your aſſertion.</p>
            <p>For the clearing whereof, its expedient to ſearch into the mind of the Spirit by the ſcope of the place. The Apoſtle in this Chapter is proſecuting that grand point of Juſtification by faith in Chriſt, and <hi>ver.</hi> 11. laies down this, <hi>that we have received attonement by him,</hi> whence he makes this corollary, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>that as by the firſt Adam ſin and death entred into the world, ſo by Ieſus Chriſt righteouſneſs and life are reſtored to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>ver.</hi> 13. he meets with an objection, <hi>that ſin is not imputed where there is no law;</hi> where he argues after this manner: <hi>If all have ſinned in the loins of Adam, then thoſe likewiſe have ſinned, who lived before the law was given by Moſes: but before the law was given there could be no ſin, becauſe where there is no law there is no tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,</hi> as Chap. 4.15. <hi>and therefore all have not ſinned in Adam.</hi> Now here the Apoſtle denies the aſſumption, or minor propoſition, affirming the contrary, that ſin was before the law given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> conſtantly affirming, that howſoever it was not imputed, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> reckoned, or accounted, or reputed to be ſin, yet indeed and in truth, ſin was then in the world; and this being of ſin in the world before the law, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. he proves by the effect, <hi>viz.</hi> death was then in the world, and that all had ſinned, becauſe that all in their ſeveral generations had taſted of death: and for a more full manifeſtation hereof, he diſtinguiſheth mankind into infants and thoſe of ripe years, wherein he affirms by the effect, that not onely thoſe that were of ripe years had died, who had ſinned in their own perſons, but even infants, who had not ſinned after the ſimilitude of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> who had committed no actual ſins in their own perſons, for which they ſhould ſuffer death, <hi>which is the wages of ſin;</hi> even they likewiſe had died,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.23.</note> as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving brought into the world with them the guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and therefore it could not be denied but that ſin was likewiſe in them.</p>
            <p>So that you that undertake to be a Proctor for all infants, for ought you have proved from this text, you will leave them all in a ſad condition, if a more ſufficient Advocate may not be found to to plead their cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:65253:86"/>Another reaſon there is, which you would fain have to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the authority of Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.16. <hi>Of ſuch is the kingdom of God:</hi> for the ſalving whereof I muſt open the words, which do evidence that the Diſciples had a prejudice and a cruell one too againſt infants, thinking (as the Anabaptiſts do) that they underſtood nothing of Chriſt nor of the kingdom of Grace; but Chriſt rebukes them, and inſtates infants of believing parents as members of the viſible Church, <hi>Of ſuch is the kingdom of God.</hi> Now we cannot think that Chriſts meaning is, of ſuch, as ſuch, is the kingdom of God, as if all infants, whether Jew or Gentile, Turk, or Pagan, belonged as ſubjects to the viſible Church, for then the infants of all the heathens ſhould be cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted members of the Church viſible, and yet their parents are without the vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ble Church; and when they ſhould grow to age, they ſhould without any ſcandal be excommunicated, which were monſtrous to affirm; much leſs can the inviſible kingdom of God be of ſuch, as if all infants, becauſe infants, were actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaved: but all that our Saviour intends is, <hi>Of ſuch, (i. e.)</hi> of ſuch in covenant-relation, is the kingdom of God, of ſuch ſubjects, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> infants as well as others. So that our Saviour did herein hold forth the common intereſt of the whole ſpecies of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants within the viſible Church; their common intereſt in Chriſt, that he is a Saviour of them, as well as a Saviour of the aged: But to conclude thence of ſuch, Therefore all ſuch, is an unheard of <hi>non ſequitur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We find ſalvation entailed upon qualifications of Graces, but not upon any age or period of life. But that whether it be for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of election or of reprobation, young as well as old are lookt upon, as in the corrupt lump, and out of which ſome are elected, the reſt are left and ſo not elected, which is to be Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated.</p>
            <p>You have one reaſon more for the defence of your aſſertion, that no child dying in infancy, &amp;c. And that, I conceive, you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by way of anticipation to what might be objected from <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.15,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.10.</note> 16, 17, 18, 19. concerning the imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin to all his poſterity, and thus you ſtate it; that when all ſhal appear before the judgement ſeat of Chriſt every one ſhall receive according to what he hath done in his body, but not to receive any thing as a puniſhment for what hath been acted in the body of another.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:65253:86"/>And I pray Sir, tell me, you that are ſo accurate, the reaſon of your limitation, why none ſhall receive any thing as a puniſhment of that which hath been acted in the perſon of another, but that we may receive a reward for the good which hath been acted in the perſon of another? where, if the text by you cited, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. be that rule you walk by, it ſhould hold for good as well as bad.</p>
            <p>But perhaps you foreſaw the inſtance that would be given in againſt you in that man Chriſt Jeſus, from the acting of whoſe perſon in his own body all other bodies that do expect, or hope for any reward of all their labours of love, they do participate,<note place="margin">Joh. 1. Ezek. 16.14.</note> 
               <hi>for of his fulneſs have we all received,</hi> and we all are made perfect through his comlineſs that he ſhall put upon us, and by his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience ſhall thoſe that are juſtified be made righteous. And therefore, my good friends, this is but <hi>gratis dictum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5.19</note> and you do herein groſly ſuborn and abuſe that place of the Apoſtle, to ſerve your baſe ends; this ſure is no better then the devils juggle, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. to mince ſo much of a text as will ſerve his turn, and to leave out the reſt, ſo to delude the Readers; I pray uſe fairer play in your next, and deal above board.</p>
            <p>The next thing I obſerve of your alike fair dealing is about that text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. <hi>that all die and go to the duſt in the firſt Adam, in that all have ſinned, or in whom all have ſinned, Rom.</hi> 5.12. and here ſure the duſt ſo flies in your eyes, that all the skil and labour you can take will never wipe it away.</p>
            <p>For firſt, you do confeſs that all Infants as well as others ſinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> and why ſhould you not alike confeſs from that very place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. that therefore judgement upon all to condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ſhould paſs upon infants as well as others; but probable it is, that here your meaning is, that <hi>Adams</hi> firſt tranſgreſſion, whereon I ſhall have occaſion more fully to anſwer, when I come to examine and reſolve your poſtſcript of Queries; till when I ſhall diſmiſs this paradox, and ſhall apply my ſelf to enquire into the mind of God, in that text by you cited, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.20. <hi>the ſoul that ſinneth it ſhall die, the ſon ſhall not bear the iniquity of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which your comment is, by death in this place is meant eternal death, that which is the portion of the wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

be caſt into the lake for the ſin of another <hi>(i. e.)</hi> for <hi>Adams</hi> ſin.</p>
            <p>But I pray Sir, what think you firſt of the ſufferings of Chriſt both in his ſoul and body?<note place="margin">

                  </gap>am. 1.12 Iſa. 53.3.</note> there was no ſin inherent in himſelf, neither of original nor actual ſins, yet was there never any ſorrow or ſufferings like unto his, and therefore called <hi>a man of ſorrowes,</hi> which though they were not eternal in reſpect of duration, yet were they eternal according to the nature and eſſence of them, and in reſpect of the dignity of the perſon, being God-man, they were equivalent to any or all of thoſe ſufferings which are eternal for time and continuance; and yet all this was undergone not for the ſatisfaction of any ſin in himſelf, but for what ſins were acted in the perſon of another. Next, what think you of thoſe infants that were drowned in the flood;<note place="margin">Gen. 19. Num. 16.17.</note> or thoſe infants which ſuffered in the deſtruction of <hi>Sodom;</hi> or thoſe infants in the conſpiracy of <hi>Corah,</hi> where the little children are ſaid to be ſwallowed into the pit?</p>
            <p>Now all of theſe infants were not born within the compaſs of the Covenant, and out of that there is no ſalvation; and actual ſin they had committed none in their own perſons, and therefore their ſuffering muſt needs be for the ſins acted by another. But to come more cloſe to the text; The ſcope of that Chapter is this: The Jews in <hi>Babylon</hi> meeting with much hardſhip in their captivity, inſtead of being humbled for their ſins, took up an unjuſt complaint againſt God, and charged him that he dealt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly with them, taking up this Proverb amongſt them, that <hi>The fathers had eaten ſowre grapes, and the childrens teeth were ſet on edge (i. e.)</hi> that their fathers had ſinned; and they who were their children ſuffered for their ſin; implicitly pleading their own inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, but in a downright way accuſing God for afflicting them for their fathers iniquities.</p>
            <p>Now this falſe charge God vindicates and clears himſelf from in this Chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. and ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 20. <hi>The ſoul that ſinneth it ſhall dye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By ſoul here is meant the perſon, the principal part being put for the whole, by a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> as <hi>Lev.</hi> 7.18, 20, 21.</p>
            <p>By dying here, more properly is underſtood a metaphorical death, <hi>viz.</hi> afflictions, wars, judgements, plague, famine, captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, loſs of comforts formerly enjoyed.

Take it of whether of theſe two you will, The words import thus much, that the man which ſinneth, what ever he be, he ſhall ſuffer, and be cut off for his ſin, himſelf, and not any other, ſhall bear the burden of it; and beyond this to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the words, to eternal, or ſecond death, or to be caſt into the lake, is not with any right reaſon to be forced from this place: For the words are to be underſtood as a direct anſwer unto the Jews charge and crimination; now we do not find, that any one of them did complain, that they ſuffered this ſecond death, or that they were caſt into the lake you ſpeak of; but onely their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint and charge was, for a bodily perſonal ſuffering here in this life, as ſome of thoſe by me formerly mentioned; the utmoſt was a death of the body, by what violence ſoever inflicted, beyond which they had no preſent experience to know, or judg; for how could they know which of their Fathers went into that lake, or ſuffered the ſecond death? And therefore if we may (as we ought to do) ſuppoſe the anſwer of God to be <hi>ad idem,</hi> and not imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to their cavil and charge, then the conſtruction of theſe words muſt neceſſarily be confined to temporal afflictions, as war, famine, &amp;c. or at worſt, to death, temporal or natural: And then what becomes of all this waſte ſtuff of yours, by your quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the words, [all muſt dye <hi>(i. e.)</hi> go to the duſt, whether righteous or unrighteous, &amp;c. Tis true, all the righteous dye as well as the unrighteous, but there is a vaſt difference in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of their deaths; It is to the righteous a thing deſired, a bridge whereby they paſs from <hi>Egypt,</hi> to <hi>Canaan;</hi> Chriſt hath by his death ſanctified it, and ſweetned it ſo to them, that they deſire to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt.<note place="margin">Phil. 1.23. Mat. 24.8.</note> But to the wicked it is the beginning of ſorrows.</p>
            <p>This might be enlarged, but to him whoſe eyes are not blinded through prejudice, tis very intelligible, that the utmoſt of the Prophets ſcope can be extended no further then this temporal death, if it be marked what the people laid to the charge of God, and ſuppoſing God likewiſe to have made a direct anſwer unto their charge, without any equivocation or mental reſervation; And ſo I leave all this that you have ſaid in the dirt, and proceed to what you further ſay.</p>

               </label> Sir, this latter abſurdity will ſtick to your skirts, as long as ever you uphold this your poſition, and that you do not recant it, as hath been by me ſufficiently proved; and for the former, it likewiſe hath been evidenced that children dying in infancy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had the act and uſe of faith, muſt unavoydably be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, were it not for the ſole good pleaſure of Gods moſt holy will, who hath choſen ſome of them according to the election of Grace, they being in the ſame lump with others.</p>
            <p>And ſo I proceed to the ſecond abſurdity, which is,</p>
            <p>[As 2. neither ſuch Gentiles or Turks, Indians and Savages, that never heard of Chriſt, who never enjoyed the Goſpel, &amp;c.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I anſwer, firſt by demanding why he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that there be ſome Gentiles that never heard of Chriſt, &amp;c. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> delivereth doctrine contrary to this, ſaying, have they not all heard? yes verily; their ſound went into all the earth, and their words unto the end of the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.18. and <hi>chap.</hi> 16.25, 26. <hi>Speaking of the myſtery which was kept ſecret ſince the world began,</hi> but now is made manifeſt, and by the Scriptures of the Prophets according to the commandement of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith; how then is it that this man ſaith, that there be ſuch Gentiles, or Turks, and the like, that never heard of Chriſt? if he hath been among ſuch, pretending himſelf to be a Miniſter of Chriſt, he ſhould have preached Chriſt unto them; But I am perſwaded that he groundeth what he ſaith, upon a report of ſome Hiſtory of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, or the like; and from thence there is as good ground to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that they may hear of Chriſt, and that there are Chriſtians in this part of the world, which worſhip that God that is the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of al things by Jeſus Chriſt, as there is for us to conclude, that
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:65253:89"/>
there is a Mahomet which the Turk doth believe in, and that there are Indians and Savages, who are ſtrangers from the life of God, and that worſhip the creature more than the Creator; for certainly they may as wel hear what we do, as we can hear what they are and what they do: and if they did but delight to retain that God in their knowledge whom we worſhip, and to entertain the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in their hearts, in whom we believe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion they might know more of God and his Son Chriſt then they do; and this doth appear from the words of Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.10, 11. <hi>He that is faithful in that which is leaſt, is faithful al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in much; and he that is unjuſt in the leaſt is unjuſt alſo in much: if therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous Mammon, who ſhall commit to your truſt the true riches?</hi> and therefore if they were faithful in the uſe of that means which they do enjoy from God, without doubt they might know more of God then they do.</p>

               </label> Well fare you good Sir, in your underſtanding; you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready diſpatcht infants, even thoſe of Pagans, and ſent them into <hi>Limbo infantum,</hi> for there is no place in heaven for them, (I mean Pagan infants) and to the Lake you ſay they muſt not go, and now you are engaged to become an advocate for infidels; and take heed at laſt you turn not proctor for the Devil, and with <hi>Origen</hi> to be ſo charitable as to have ſome hopes of his ſalvation: for truly, for what yet appears by the word, he is in as great a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity for ſalvation as thoſe infidels are: Salvation, according to Scripture-account, is incompaſſed within the verge of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and doth not go beyond it. The Scripture leaves men out of covenant in a hopeleſs condition.</p>
            <p>But againſt what I ſay, that ſome Gentiles yet never heard of Chriſt, you produce that of <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.18. and 16.25, 26. <hi>that their ſound, i. e.</hi> (of the preaching of the Goſpel) <hi>went into all the earth, and their words into the ends of the world,</hi> as it was made known unto all nations. But my good friend, you that miſt before in your Chronography; I believe you are here likewiſe out in your Coſmography, for here the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the miniſters of the Goſpel, yea and of thoſe, not as ſent to the Gentiles neither, but to the Jews, of whom he here treats, and ſhews their inexcuſable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for not obeying the Goſpel, <hi>whoſe ſound went to the ends of the world:</hi> But what ends of the world? we know that the word <hi>world</hi> is ſometimes ſtraitned to <hi>Iudea</hi> onely, as ſome are wont to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:65253:89"/>
conſtrue that <hi>of the taxing of the world by Auguſtus Caeſar, Luke</hi> 2. onely of <hi>Iudea.</hi> Now ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>the Iews cannot plead ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the Goſpel, becauſe the preachers of it have ſounded it to them every where. Have they not heard?</hi> ver. 18. <hi>did not Iſrael know?</hi> ver. 19. but to Iſrael he ſaith, <hi>All the day long have I ſtretched out my hands,</hi> ver. 21. and you that are ſo indulgent over thoſe pitiful Pagans, how is it in right reaſon imaginable, that when <hi>Paul</hi> writ this Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that every mothers ſon under heaven ſhould have been a hearer of the Goſpel, when as the compaſs of the earth is many thouſand miles about, and ſo many nations which have never been diſcovered till of late years, yet that they then ſhould have heard the Goſpel, and that in ſo ſhort a time? ſure herein your pen did run before your wit, in underſtanding thoſe words in ſuch a ſenſe: and therefore, my friend, if you mean to make a right conſtruction of thoſe words, you muſt not extend them to ſuch a latitude, as that all the poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> had immediately upon the death of Chriſt the Goſpel preached to them; but you muſt interpret that place, by comparing it with other ſuch like univerſal expreſſions, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.23. <hi>Chriſt healed all manner of ſickneſs, and all manner of diſeaſes:</hi> and <hi>Act.</hi> 10.38. <hi>healed all that were oppreſſed with devils:</hi> and Act. 10.12. <hi>All manner of four footed beaſts, and wild beaſts, and creeping things, and foules of the ayre,</hi> appeared by <hi>Peter</hi> as in a great ſheet: and <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.5. <hi>All Iudea went out to Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, and all were baptiſed in the river Iordan:</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.19. <hi>the Phariſees ſay of Chriſt, Behold the world goeth after him:</hi> and Mat. 8.34. <hi>the whole city went out to meet Chriſt:</hi> and <hi>Act.</hi> 2.5. <hi>men of every nation under heaven.</hi> For as I ſaid before, how can it ſtand with common ſenſe and right reaſon, that in ſo ſmall a tract of time, thoſe inhabitants of the utmoſt skirts of the world, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, Peru, Scythia, Tartary, Braſil, Mexico, China,</hi> and other corners of the unknowne world, <hi>ſhould hear that joyful ſound,</hi> when as neither the <hi>Acts</hi> make mention of any preregrination to thoſe places, nor any Eccleſiaſtical hiſtory gives intelligence thereof? yea and when as to Fathers who lived four or five hundred years after Chriſt, both the <hi>Indies</hi> were then unknown unto them; yea and when they came to beat firſt diſcovered, there appeared not the leaſt footſteps of the knowledge of the true God. And therefore the ſenſe can be no otherwiſe then this, that whereas before the coming of Chriſt, the word and promiſes, and oracles of God,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:65253:90"/>
were appendent onely to the Jewiſh nation; now Chriſt being manifeſted in the fleſh,<note place="margin">Acts 17.30.</note> 
               <hi>he commandeth all men every where to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent;</hi> now none were excluded, every nation aſwel as the Jews might have a ſhare of Chriſt crucified, and according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion received from Jeſus Chriſt, they ſhould preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to them, ſo far as in reaſon might be expected from ſo ſmall a company as did undertake that charge; and many places of the world they had then gone through.</p>
            <p>And Sir, to what you ſay, [that if there be ſuch Turks and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles that never heard of Chriſt; if he hath been amongſt ſuch, he ſhould have preached Chriſt unto them.] I muſt tell you for your better information, that the Goſpel of it ſelf is not preachable to all: had not God expreſly commanded <hi>Ionas</hi> to preach to <hi>Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh,</hi> he had not ſinned, if he had preached to them. Sir, it is a ſpecial miſſion that gives warrant unto any, when, and to whom, to preach thoſe glad tidings, which is not ſo common to all, but peculiar to ſuch, where God hath a people to be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red according to the purpoſe of election;<note place="margin">Act. 18.10. Act. 16.7. Mat. 10.5. Act. 16.6. Rom. 10.15. Jer. 23.21.</note> in other caſes they are inhibited though they had determined to preach it: <hi>the Apoſtle aſſayed to go into Bithynia,</hi> but the Spirit ſuffered them not; yea their commiſſion is limited, <hi>they may not go into the way of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and into the city of Samaria not to enter:</hi> the Holy Ghoſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids them to preach in <hi>Aſia, and how then ſhall they preach except they be ſent?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſee by experience in thoſe of your gang, <hi>that there is a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and no ſending.</hi> And I pray tell me, how could any thing of God or Chriſt in the time of the law, be diſcovered to any in a ſaving way, when as the purpoſe of God that way, was limited to the narrow ſcantling of the Jewiſh nation?<note place="margin">Pſal. 147.19.20.

               <hi>He ſhewed his word unto Iacob his ſtatutes and judgements unto Iſrael; he hath not dealt ſo with any nation, &amp;c. You onely have I known of all the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the earth, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No Sir, ſuch prankes of preaching the Goſpel, where they have not a ſpecial miſſion, would ſuit far better with ſuch Itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants as you are, to proſelyte the Indians; the onely miſchief would be this,<note place="margin">Mat. 23.15.</note> that when you had <hi>proſelyted them, they would be twofold more the children of hell then they were before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By what afterwards you write, you ſeem to tread the mizmaze, <hi>viz.</hi> that we receiving what knowledge we have of ſuch, upon a report of ſome hiſtory or travellers, and therefore that they may
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:65253:90"/>
hear what we are and do, aſwel as we hear what they are and do. Sir, if you look about you, there is not the like reciprocal reaſon for the one as for the other. Thoſe travellers you ſpeak of, of ours, are men of parts and ingenuity, and through long pains and difficulties, have made new diſcoveries of ſeveral parts of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable world; but who are the inhabitants? ſurely a people of a ſtrange temper, conſtitution and condition, rather like beaſts, nay Devils, than men, I mean for ſome of them; nay ſuch as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaks of, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.5. <hi>a people of a ſtrange ſpeech &amp; of a hard lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and whoſe words thou canſt not underſtand,</hi> Canibals, Satyres, who do really worſhip the Devil.</p>
            <p>And tell me, how ſhall theſe reject the means, who ſtand in no capacity to receive it; and ſurely Sir, if your will and judgement have ſo much of obſtinacy in them, as that they canot take im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion by an hiſtorical faith of what is delivered from perſons of an undoubted integrity: I ſhall much doubt how it will be pliable to the entertayning of a juſtifying faith. <hi>He that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful in the leaſt, will be unfaithful alſo in much,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 16.10.</note> according to your own inſtance.</p>
            <p>And to what you ſay, that if they did but delight to retain that God in their knowledge whom we worſhip, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in whom we believe:</p>
            <p>But I pray tell me, how is this poſſible for them to have this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light you ſpeak of, when perhaps they never heard of the true God, nor his Son Jeſus Chriſt? and next by whom is any ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light wrought in the hearts of any people, but onely by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who hath already denyed it to them in his decree?</p>
            <p>And therefore what other means they do enjoy, which would require their faithful improvement of them, and of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge therein, I know of none; and if you have found out any, if you pleaſe to ſet it down in plain Engliſh, it will prove a greater diſcovery then that of <hi>America</hi> it ſelf, unleſs you mean thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant dayly lecturers, the ſun, moon, and ſtars, which in a dumb language preach out the glory of God. But the quickeſt-ſighted of all the Aſtrologers could never read any thing of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in all the firmament of heaven,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1 23.</note> 
               <hi>which is to the Iews a ſtumbling-block, and to the Gentiles fooliſhneſs,</hi> the Scriptures whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſcribing the knowledge of the myſtery to the Son of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing it from the boſome of the Father, and to the Spirit of God; but utterly denying ſo much as a thought of it to any of the

            <p>[But put caſe it be granted, for Arguments ſake, that they never heard of Chriſt, why then, ſaith the man, how ſhall they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, of whom they have not heard? from <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. and how can they reject that which was never tendered unto them?</p>
            <p>Why then I ſay again, how have infants faith? for they never heard of Chriſt as they are new born infants; and I ſay likewiſe, that if thoſe Gentiles he ſpeaketh of never heard of Chriſt, nor yet could, notwithſtanding all that they could do in the uſe of that means they do enjoy, then their not knowing of Chriſt and believing in him as we do, will never be charged upon them as ſin: For we do not find that the Lord Jeſus doth require the uſe of a talent of them, which never received any of him to uſe.]</p>

            <p>And kind Sir, if you reviſe your own poſition, it is limited to the free tenders of Chriſt in the Goſpel; and therfore as you put the caſe, your ſuppoſition utterly claſheth with what you have in your

Rom. 2.14.</note> yet that the Gentiles have ſo much made known unto them by the inviſible things of God, and the objective works of the creation, and the reliques of the law of nature, ſo far as to render them inexcuſable, I ſhall joyne with you in it, and give my vote againſt them.</p>
            <p>But if you have any ſecret reſerve (for indeed you are a pitiful ſoul) that any of thoſe herd of Goats, the Gentiles I mean, ſhould have any poſſibility of ſalvation, or hopes to be excuſed in the day of Judgement from receiving of the juſt reward of all their iniquities,<note place="margin">Joh. 15.5.

If it ſhould be otherwiſe, then farewel the prerogative of the Jew above the Gentile, of the Chriſtian Church above the Pagans.

            <p>But I pray Sir, tell me in good earneſt what your meaning is by thoſe words you thus write, <hi>viz.</hi> The Gentiles, if they cannot, notwithſtanding all that they can do, hear of Chriſt, &amp;c. which, as the words import, imply an abominable ſlander againſt the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God, as though the Gentiles had a deſire, and thereupon did endeavour to know and learn the mind of Chriſt, but being impeded by a more ſupreme power, were not able to compaſs their deſires.</p>
            <p>Sir, learn to be more modeſt and reverent in treating of ſuch divine things. Alas, ſo far are the heathens for a can or a will, I mean, power or deſire, that there is neither of them in profeſſed Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.13.</note> but what is of Gods own working, who giveth both to will and to do according to his good pleaſure. And as for the heathen, inſtead of doing, or any deſires thereunto, as to good,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:65253:92"/>
there is nothing but backwardneſs, indiſpoſition, averſneſs, yea an enmity againſt any thing that is really good, at leaſt in a ſaving way.</p>
            <p>But alas, what perſons, or cauſe is there in the world, that are ſo baſe and degenerate, that cannot ſuborne ſome luxuriant tongues to plead their caſe, though never ſo abominable?</p>
            <p>I have now done with this, and ſo proceed to hear what you can ſpeak for your ſelfe in the defence of the poſition from the third abſurdity, which is this;</p>
            <p>The third abſurdity.</p>
            <p>[If the foreſight of ſin ſhould be the cauſe of reprobation, then the elect ſhould be equally lyable to the decree of reprobation as the reprobates themſelves, they all being alike in the corrupt maſs and lump of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> See how he minceth his argument, that he may bring forth abſurdities from his own expreſſions, and then father them upon us. In the front of his argument he putteth in unbelief, and the rejecting of the means, but leaveth out the word continuing; and now he hath thruſt out all, except it be this one ſingle term, <hi>Sin,</hi> that he may bring, reprobation to eternal deſtruction, to the narrow ſcantling of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion: but that ſhall never be granted by me, until I ſee a better proof for it than he hath yet brought, and I can allow him more Scriptures then he hath ſet down to his argument, <hi>Iob</hi> 14.4. and 15.14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. all which, together with the Scriptures he bringeth, do I confeſs, <hi>prove that the whole lump of mankind is polluted with Sin;</hi> and I deny not, but that this pollution or corruption, is in a meaſure from <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion; but that any ones being reprobated to everlaſting deſtruction in the lake of fire, which is the ſecond death, is for <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion, I deny; for although all the fruits and effects of that ſin in the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> do accompany us, <hi>untill we come to the duſt from whence we were taken,</hi> which is <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.16, 17, 18, 19. <hi>Womens ſorrow, being multiplyed, and their conception, and bringing forth children in ſorrow, together with the curſe that is upon the ground for mans ſake, ſo as that man muſt eat of it in ſorrow all the dayes of his life, eating bread in the ſweat of his face, being accompanied with pain and ſickneſs, which are the companions of death, till he return to the ground; for out of it was he taken, for</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>duſt thou art, and unto duſt thou ſhalt return:</hi> and this was the ſentence of that condemnation that God hath pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:65253:93"/>
againſt the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> or 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.27. earthy man, and we being then in him when the ſin was committed, and the ſentence pronounced, we have our part with him in theſe things, as our portion in this life, for the original ſin, or firſt tranſgreſſion: But the holy Spirit in Scripture doth no where declare, as I could ever yet find, nor as any one could ever yet ſhew me, that mans repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation to the ſecond death is for being in <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, nor for ſin in their own perſons, no nor yet for unbelief ſimply ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered but for continuing in ſin and unbelief.</p>
            <p>For if they do repent, confeſs, and forſake their ſins, they ſhall find mercy, and be ſaved, as hath been already proved: and if the elect ſhould continue in ſin and unbelief, and not repent, and believe, or imbrace the means of Salvation, they ſhould be equally lyable to the decree of Reprobation, as the reprobates themſelves, and there would be no difference; but they in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, believing and embracing the means of ſalvation, fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the unchangeable decree of Gods election, ſo as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not miſs of ſalvation, as hath been already ſhewed.]</p>

               </label> Truly Sir, before this I did not rightly apprehend where the ſhooe did wring; but now I find that it is Original ſin that pinches you ſo ſore, that you cannot well endure the name of it; which had I foreſeen, I would not have minced any thing in the Argument, no not ſo much as the continuing in ſin: for howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it is, that we affirm that Original ſin is an hereditary diſeaſe which every ſoul brings with it into the world, yet it leaves not a man ſuddenly, no not when he is regenerate, but continues to the end of a mans dayes,</p>
            <p>It is the very laſt enemy of ours that death deſtroyes; ſo that in reſpect of this,
<q>Ante obitum nemo ſupremaque funera debet dici beatus.</q>
Now what you have to ſay againſt our doctrine of Original ſin, I find not much in this your diſcourſe, for this you grant;</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the whole lump of mankind is polluted with ſin, and which pollution, as you ſay, flows from <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, that all the fruits and effects of that ſin do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company us till death: there is onely then your bare denial that eternal death is not the reward or wages of this ſinful pollution, the contrary whereof is incumbent on me to prove, to make my charge good againſt you with that third abſurdity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:65253:93"/>Now to prove that the firſt ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> was ours, not becauſe he is our father by nature, (though that be a ground of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation alſo) but becauſe he is ſuch a father by Covenant and law, the law and Covenant of works being laid in pawn in his hand; we are to underſtand, that there be three parts in Original ſinne.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, a partaking of the firſt ſin of <hi>Adam;</hi> we all ſinned in him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12, 14, 15.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, the want of the Image of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23. cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the glory of God, or original righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Concupiſcence, or a bentneſs or proneneſs of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture unto ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7, 14, 17, 23, 24.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt, <hi>Adams</hi> ſin is ours really and truly, not ſo much becauſe it is ours, as becauſe it is imputed to be ours by God, who ſo contrived the law of works, as that it ſhould be made with <hi>Adam,</hi> not as a ſingle father or perſon, but with <hi>Adam</hi> as a publique perſon repreſenting all mankind, and having our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon nature as a father, both by nature and law, which came from the meer free-will of God: He was as the root and ſtock of all mankind, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>By one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners, (i. e.)</hi> morally and legally, but not phyſically and perſonally, the fruit and effect of which is death and damnation; for <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>The wages of ſin is death,</hi> not onely temporal or natural death, but as the Apoſtles Antitheſis neceſſarily carries it, <hi>ſpiritual and eternal death,</hi> in oppoſition to eternal life acquired by Jeſus Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea and the whole ſeries and purport of the Apoſtles diſcourſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. to <hi>ver.</hi> 19. carries this clear, that every mouth may be ſtopped, by a compariſon of our righteouſneſs and life received by Jeſus Chriſt, with ſin and death contracted from <hi>Adam;</hi> that as by the diſobedience of <hi>Adam</hi> we were made ſinners, <hi>viz.</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by imputation, his ſin being laid upon our account, as much as if we our ſelves had eaten of the forbidden fruit: <hi>So by the obedience of Chriſt we are made righteous (i. e.)</hi> righteous by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, God being ſo pleaſed to accept of Chriſt his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, as though we in our own perſons had fulfilled all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, either in doing or in ſuffering. See for further ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. and 15.22. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing conſiderable in original ſin, is a privation of the Image of God, the glory of God, or original righteouſneſs; of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:65253:94"/>
this ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.29. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.24. which upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had been hereditary, had man kept his firſt ſtation; but he failing, in the breach of the holy law of God, he loſt that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, both to himſelf and all his poſterity; So that, there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably ſucceeding a defect of conformity to the law of God, which ſinleſs nature did enjoy, neceſſarily muſt it draw with it the ſin of that nature which it voluntarily had contracted, <hi>viz.</hi> Original unrighteouſneſs. Whence I reaſon thus; Every tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the law of God takes along with it the true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per name and nature of ſin, and to have eternal death as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thereof, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23. But every defect of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with the law of God is ſuch a tranſgreſſion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Minor is proved from thoſe places, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.10. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. <hi>cum multis aliis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third thing conſiderable is a proneneſs, aptitude, and bentneſs to ſin, not by imputation, but by inclination: As the young Lion, and the young Serpent, have not the bloudy, and ſtinging nature of the old Lion, and the old Serpent, by imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but by natural and intrinſecal inherencie: ſo it is with men from the womb, they are ſinners from the birth, bringing into the world <hi>a body of ſin and death.</hi> Whence I argue thus; Every evill concupiſcence, or proneneſs in man to ſin, or rebellion to the law of God, or enmity to God, carries with it the name and nature of ſin: But original ſin (Synecdochically taken; for the habit of original unrighteouſneſs) is that evil Concupiſcence or proneneſs to ſin, &amp;c. Therefore.</p>
            <p>For the Major, I preſume none dare queſtion it; and for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, that is confirmed abundantly, and that in a ſpecial manner in the greateſt part of <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. where the nature of original ſin is moſt lively repreſented, and the Apoſtle not onely for himſelf, but for all others, bemoanes their ſad eſtate, in reſpect of the natural inherency of that depravation of our nature.</p>
            <p>And whereas you, Sir, were pleaſed to ſupply me with places to prove what I intended as to original ſin, I muſt tell you, it was not for want of ſtock that I had then in ſtore, but onely becauſe I would not then in ſo ſhort an epitome be tedious and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to ſuch diſſatisfied perſons, for whoſe alone ſatisfaction I compoſed that breviary; but never intending it ſhould have been expoſed to publick view, it was onely your pleaſure to bring it
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:65253:94"/>
into the ſun light, naked and bare as it was. And therefore that you may ſee that the ſubject is not any wayes lame or defective for want of ſufficient authority to ſupport it, take theſe texts of Scripture, <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> for the confirmation of it. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. and 8.21. <hi>Iob</hi> 14.5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.10. <hi>Ier.</hi> 17.9. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.12. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 6.16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 8.6, 7. <hi>&amp;c. Eph.</hi> 2.3. and 4.22. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.9, 11. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.14, 15 <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For what you conclude this paragraph with, that if ſinners ſhould repent, confeſs, and forſake their ſins, they ſhould find mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; And if the elect ſhould continue in ſin and not repent, &amp;c. they ſhould be equally lyable to the decree of Reprobation; I ſay Sir, though to affirm this doth utterly interfere with your firſt poſition, where you affirm that the elect cannot become re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, neither can reprobates become elect: And yet there is ſome truth in it according to the Goſpel manner of expreſſions; but this hath been fully ſpoken to already. Your next encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is, to anſwer a place by me quoted, where you write thus.</p>
            <p>[But yet leſt it ſhould be thought that there is ſome weight in that Scripture which he quoteth out of <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath even as others,</hi> to prove that reprobation to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death, is for that ſin in <hi>Adam,</hi> or that infants dying in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, ſhould be caſt into the lake of fire for the ſame; I doubt not, but by the help of my God I ſhall make it appear, that there is no ſuch thing in it: for firſt conſider, that theſe words in <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>you hath he quickened who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to their being in the corrupt maſs or lump of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, for that is but one, being in the ſingular number; but that which is there ſpoken of, is in the plural number, or more than one, to wit, treſpaſes and ſins.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it doth appear that it doth not relate to that ſin they had as they were new born infants, becauſe it relateth to their converſation, or courſe of life, as they had a being in this world, <hi>ver.</hi> 2.3. <hi>wherein in time paſt ye walked according to the courſe of this world,</hi> amongſt whom we all had our converſation in times paſt, &amp;c. By which it doth appear, that he doth not ſpeak to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> of what they were as they firſt came into the world as Infants; for they could not upon that account be ſaid to walk according to the courſe of this world, neither can new born In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, as ſuch, be ſaid to have their converſation in times paſt
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:65253:95"/>
in the luſt of the fleſh, &amp; of the mind; and therefore they were not children of wrath upon that account: but the Apoſtle there ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of that courſe of life or converſation in which they lived in time paſt, as they were grown perſons in the luſts of the fleſh and the mind, fulfilling the deſires thereof, <hi>and being by nature the children of wrath even as others.</hi>]</p>

               </label> What man, are you ſo confident of this firſt fruits of your brain, as to think that you have anſwered all things of weight, in what I have formerly written to your poſitions? Truly Sir, if I have any judgement at all, there is not one parcel of all that I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, that you have given the leaſt colour of ſatisfaction to.</p>
            <p>But let us examine the reaſons you give in, why thoſe words <hi>were the children of wrath even as others,</hi> cannot prove reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſecond death, or expoſe infants to a deſert of the lake of fire.</p>
            <p>Your firſt reaſon is, becauſe thoſe words <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>you hath he quickned who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> cannot relate to their being in the corrupt lump, for that is but one in the ſingular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but that ſpoken of here is in the plural, more than one, <hi>viz.</hi> treſpaſſes and ſins.</p>
            <p>A good Critick I aſſure you; but to this I anſwer. Firſt, that though the Scripture when it ſpeaks of original ſin, may ſpeak of it in the ſingular number, yet oftentimes it is deſcribed by words of the plural number. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. the original carries it, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I was ſhapen in iniquities, and in ſins did my mother conceive me.</hi> and Joh. 9.34. <hi>thou waſt altogether born in ſins,</hi> and Col. 2.13. <hi>you being dead in your ſins;</hi> And ſo here.</p>
            <p>Secondly you muſt know, that every particular perſon is the ſubject of that ſin, and in every member and part of that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſon is that ſin inherent; there is an infective that hath ſpread over both body and ſoul, and even all the faculties of them both, having contracted that defilement by an hereditary propagation; and why may not the Holy Ghoſt, for the exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating of the greatneſs of our natural corruption, make uſe of words in the plural number, in ſetting forth of this ſin, as uſually it doth, without the cenſure of a <hi>Thomas Tazwel?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, I do willingly acknowledge that <hi>ver.</hi> 1. Actual ſins committed by men when full grown, are here ſpoken of and meant, but not excluſively to original ſin, that is underſtood as well as actual, and both of theſe will neceſſarily require a word of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:65253:95"/>
the plural number; Actual ſins as the ſtreams running in all their veins, and their whole converſation in the time of their pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage here; but original ſin as the <hi>fomes</hi> and fountain whence thoſe actuall ſins had their firſt conception, birth, and nurſery, being deep rooted, and faſt rivited in the head and heart.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, you might eaſily perceive what I chiefly inſiſted on in the quoting of that Scripture, having ſet it down in words at length and not in figures, <hi>by nature children of wrath.</hi> So that this your firſt reaſon will ſtand you in little ſtead, as to acquit you from this third abſurdity.</p>
            <p>Neither will your ſecond perform any greater exploits, than his fellow that went before him; for where you beat the ayr, with your walking and converſation, <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3. I muſt tell you, I inſiſt not on it, neither am I ſuch an innocent as to make that applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to infants. No Sir, it is the cloſe of the 3. <hi>ver.</hi> which I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intend, and which the Holy Ghoſt applies ſingly to the heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and original depravation of our ſinful nature, lineally deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from our <hi>primogenitor Adam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 5.3.</note> who howſoever <hi>he was created in the image of God, yet he begat children in his own likeneſs after his own image, i. e.</hi> deprived of the image of God, and ſinful like himſelf, <hi>and by nature children of wrath:</hi> To which words you would fain ſay ſomewhat, and ſo you do, but to little purpoſe and that which you do ſay is this.</p>
            <p>[But now the queſtion is, <hi>how they were by nature children of wrath?</hi> ſay ſome, becauſe nature led them to the doing of theſe things, and to the living in ſuch a filthy converſation.</p>
            <p>But I have better thoughts of nature, and yet I deſire to think no better of it than the Scripture ſpeaketh of it; and my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it is this, that nature is ſo far from leading men into ſin, that the teaching of it are againſt ſins; which I prove by theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons being grounded upon Scripture.</p>

            <p>And whereas you ſay, you have better thoughts of Nature, Sir you need not tell me ſo, I know you have; ſeeing by you, and thoſe of your party, the bond-woman is advanced equal to the free-woman; the ſervant ſet up in honour to the diſgrace and contumely of the miſtreſs, Nature (I mean) being placed by

            <p>Beſides, I believe you have not the front to affirme that the Gentiles did by nature worſhip one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; or that they did abſtain from falling down before, <hi>or worſhipping the creature more then the Creator,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1.25.</note> or that they obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a ſeventh day Sabbath; Nature, I am ſure, never directed them to ſuch principles.</p>
            <p>Search all the records of the chiefeſt of the heathens, even thoſe that have aſpired to the higheſt pitch of all humane and natural knowledge: yet in thoſe their loftieſt ſpeculations concerning the nature of divine things they were miſerably blind.</p>

            <p>I have done with the firſt reaſon, and left it naked and bare; I ſhall next proceed to your ſecond reaſon, which as it is by you worded, is ſcarce common ſenſe, but ſuch as it is, take it thus.</p>
            <p n="2">[2. <hi>Becauſe thoſe that were given over of God to a reprobate mind, being filled with all unrighteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 1.28. are ſaid <hi>ver.</hi> 31. <hi>to to be without natural affections:</hi> now if natural affections had been ſuch an unrighteous thing, as that it ſhould lead them into ſin, and they being filled with all unrighteouſneſs, could not have been without it.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer; Firſt you miſtake in your reading, tis af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the ſingular number and not affections.</p>
            <p>Secondly the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> rendred by the Tranſlators natural affection, is yet by them in the margent rendred unſociable, and if <hi>Scapulaes</hi> Lexicon be conſulted with, ſuch are there denoted; and ſo the word properly ſignifies <hi>in quo non ineſt affectus amoris illius mutui inter parentes &amp; liberos,</hi> who are deſtitute of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal love that ought to be between husband and wiſe, parents and children.</p>
            <p>And now be judge your ſelf, what a ſad reaſon you have brought upon the Stage for the advancing of nature, that (as you ſay) it is ſo far from leading men to ſin, that the teachings of it are againſt ſin; becauſe, (for ſuch is the ſtrength of your reaſon, or elſe it is nothing) <hi>ſuch given over by God to a reprobate mind,</hi> are without that reciprocal or mutual love that ought to be between husband and wife, parents and children. I pray Sir, in the next look before you leap.</p>
            <p>And now for the third and laſt reaſon, which is of the ſame ſize the former were, and this it is.</p>
            <p>Becauſe the Apoſtle himſelf directeth the Saints to the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:65253:97"/>
teaching of nature it ſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14. and certainly if <hi>Paul</hi> had been of that mind, that nature had been ſuch an evil principle, as that it being followed, would lead men into a wicked and filthy converſation, he would never have mentioned it as a teacher un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; therefore the teaching of nature doth not lead men into ſin, but the contrary.]</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> The Apoſtle in this part of the Chapter, is giving directions what ſuits beſt with decency, and order in their Church-aſſemblies, and in particular concerning prayer, whether covered or uncove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and thereby occaſionally <hi>of ſhort hair and long hair,</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>Doth not nature it ſelf teach you that if a man have long hair it is a ſhame unto him:</hi> the doubt now is, what is meant by nature here? and firſt, not any principle connatural to man in the ſtate of innocency; for thereof there is neither precept, nor rule, nor example, either for long hair or ſhort hair.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, by nature is to be underſtood, that which by a common conſent was taken up, and brought it into a cuſtom or faſhion, and that eſpecially among the Greeks: for if we look upon other nations, and take the pains to ſearch Antiquity concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their faſhions, you ſhall find that it was a long time before the <hi>Romans</hi> uſed any clipping of the hair, neither was it practiſed in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Germany</hi> till of later years; nor would <hi>Lycurgus</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it among the <hi>Lacedemonians;</hi> and if it were unnatural, <hi>why did Abſalom were long hair?</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.9. <hi>or why was the law of the Nazarites permitted?</hi> It is very apparent therefore that the Apoſtles meaning is, that cuſtome being (as it were another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) it was not the manner, cuſtome and faſhion of theſe parts, at leaſt among the <hi>Corinthians, to weare long hair,</hi> becauſe it was an Argument of too much effeminacy. And now Sir, do but reviſe the ſtrength of your reaſon as I have clothed it, and ſee what weight it may bear which any man of common reaſon; and thus it lies; the teachings of nature lead not to ſin, becauſe the Apoſtle directs the Saints what is fit for them to do about long hair, from what the cuſtome was then in uſe among the Grecians.</p>
            <p>I pray Sir take more reaſon with you when you next offer any reaſon to a reaſonable man.</p>
            <p>Your next endeavour is, to make a gloſs upon this text, but it is ſuch a one as doth corrupt the text; and thus it is.</p>
            <p>[But as the law written in tables of ſtone did diſcover or make known ſin to the Jews, ſo the law of nature did diſcover or make

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> In anſwer to this paraphraſe of yours, it is not enough for me to unſay what you have ſaid, but rather to ſay that you cannot gainſay in giving of the genuine ſenſe of the words, <hi>we are all by nature the children of wrath, i. e.</hi> we that are converted, whether Jews or Gentiles, all were alike <hi>children of wrath:</hi> wherein there are two things to be opened, firſt, what it is to be <hi>a child of wrath,</hi> ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what it is to be ſo by nature?</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>what it is to be a child of wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, ſome by this do underſtand one that is guilty of and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to eternal death and condemnation becauſe of ſin; but this, though it be ſomewhat, yet it is not the whole; for <hi>Adam</hi> after his ſin committed, was made obnoxious to the wrath of God, and guilty of eternal death, and yet he could not be ſaid to be a ſon, <hi>or child of wrath;</hi> for by this manner of ſpeaking, ſuch an one is denoted as is born ſuch, and by his nature is ſuch.</p>
            <p>For the clearing whereof, take notice of ſome ſuch parallel pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. It is well known to thoſe who are Divines indeed, that theſe are Hebraiſmes, to ſay, one is a ſon, <hi>or child of perdition,</hi> as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.12. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3. or that one is <hi>a child of diſobedience, Eph.</hi> 2.2. and 5.6. and <hi>Col.</hi> 3.6. and hence this manner of ſpeaking doth a iſe, becauſe whoſoever is begotten or born of a man is a man, that which is of a horſe is a horſe, &amp;c. and therefore by the name of the Son of man is underſtood him, not which is ſimply a man as <hi>Adam</hi> was, but him that is born of a man: <hi>Adam</hi> was a man made, not born, and therefore he is called a man, but not the Son of man. It is obſerved therefore, that the Hebrews in this their manner of ſpeaking, when they ſay thou art a ſon <hi>or child of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, a ſon of perdition, &amp;c.</hi> that they aſſign as it were, <hi>diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> and <hi>perdition,</hi> to be as the father, and that thou art born of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:65253:98"/>
that; and therefore that ſuch expreſſions do not barely ſignifie that thou art diſobedient, but that thou wert born diſobedient; not that thou art in a periſhing condition, <hi>but that thou wert born a ſon of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;</hi> not that thou art a ſinner, <hi>but that thou waſt born a ſinner.</hi> So likewiſe in thoſe words; <hi>a child of wrath,</hi> not that thou art obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to wrath and condemnation becauſe of thy ſins, <hi>but that thou art born a child of wrath,</hi> guilty of eternal condemnation: ſo much of the firſt.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing conſiderable is, <hi>how they were by nature the children of wrath:</hi> The word <hi>nature</hi> hath ſeveral acceptations; Firſt, ſometimes it is taken for the ſubſtance and eſſence of a thing; but thus, acording to his eſſence and ſubſtance, <hi>man is not a child of wrath,</hi> becauſe the ſubſtance is not ſin, though it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with ſin; Secondly, for the firſt principle of motion and reſt in every thing, whether that principle be in the ſubſtance, or that it be the natural quality and propriety of the thing. And after this manner the firſt nature of man was good, yea very good, for in that the Lord did imprint a power of motion to that which was good; to know, love and worſhip God, and thereby to have life everlaſting: but this nature was loſt by the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof there ſucceeded a naughty quality, whereby it comes to paſs that there is no natural motion in us, but unto that which is evil, <hi>viz.</hi> againſt God, and againſt his ſon Jeſus Chriſt, and no reſt but in that which is not good.</p>
            <p>This evil quality came by the temptation of the Devil, and it is as a peſtilence that hath infected both the ſoul and body of man; man I ſay remaining the ſame in his eſſence and ſubſtance, is infected with the venome of this evil quality, ſo that he can ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or work nothing but that which is like himſelf, becauſe from this he is moved unto all actions.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that there ariſe all the evil thougths in the mind, all the perverſe and diſtempered affections in the heart, and all wicked motions and deſires in the will.</p>
            <p>And this corruption of the whole nature, which is otherwiſe called concupiſcence, the Apoſtle cals in this place nature, <hi>viz.</hi> the firſt principle or beginning of all evil actions and motions, whether external, or internal; and therefore whereas this is ſin, it doth deſervedly make ſuch the children of wrath.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, nature is oftentimes taken for nativity, or birth, <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra a naſcendo,</hi> becauſe that every one being conceived in ſins,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:65253:98"/>
and born in iniquities,<note place="margin">Pſalm 51.5.</note> and that we are born ungodly and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to God, and therefore moſt worthy that God ſhould be angry with us, and inflict eternal puniſhments on us; and therefore in this ſenſe likewiſe are we ſaid to be <hi>the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath, i. e.</hi> rom our firſt conception and nativity, and becauſe we are deſcended from <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſinned in him, and all are born <hi>children of wrath,</hi> even infants likewiſe, <hi>though they have not ſinned after the ſimilitude of Adams tranſgreſſion, i. e.</hi> actually,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.14.</note> yet becauſe they are born of ſinful parents, the infection becomes hereditary to them, and they likewiſe <hi>children of wrath as well as others:</hi> After this manner of ſpeech is that of the Apoſtle <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. <hi>We which are Iews by nature, i. e.</hi> Jews by birth and nativity.</p>
            <p>And by this I hope the judicious Reader will find that I have both confuted your reaſons and confounded your gloſs, ſo that the third abſurdity will ſtick as cloſe to your propoſition as the ſpots do to the <hi>Leopard:</hi> and now I ſhall have leiſure to attend your motion in the removal of your quarters to the fourth abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, which is this.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Paul</hi> was miſtaken, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.21. in not aſſigning ſin to be the cauſe of reprobation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. Paul</hi> was not miſtaken, for he hath aſſigned continuing <hi>in ſin and unbelief</hi> to be the cauſe of reprobation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.32. and 11.20. and 1.2, 6, 28.</p>

               </label> Sir, this hath been your dealing in all this tract of reprobation, wherein you make no diſtinction between non-election or nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive reprobation which is before all time, whereon your poſition is built, and againſt which my undertakings are, as you deliver it: and whereof there is no cauſe aſſignable, beſides the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Gods moſt holy will; and that reprobation which is in time; and whereof ſin is the cauſe, and whereunto thoſe Scriptures by you quoted do anſwer, which no man contradicts.</p>
            <p>But yet this laſt reprobation, or that in time, is not immutable as is the other;<note place="margin">Jer. 6.30. Iſa. 1.25. Zac. 13.9.

               </label> Sir, for the reſolving of your queſtion, and ſatisfying of the ſcruple, I muſt tell you, firſt, that God is ſaid to have hated <hi>Eſau</hi> before he was born, or that he had done either good or evil; that is called hatred, comparatively, in reſpect of that love he ſhewed unto <hi>Iacob;</hi> he may be ſaid to hate him becauſe he loved him leſs than he did <hi>Iacob:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 29.31.</note> Thus <hi>Leah</hi> was ſaid to be hated by <hi>Iacob,</hi> comparatively with the love ſhewed to <hi>Rachel,</hi> becauſe ſhe was leſs beloved then <hi>Rachel:</hi> ſo he that ſerves two maſters, will hate the one, and love the other, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> will love him leſs then the other: And thus God loves the reprobates leſs than he doth the elect; but it cannot hence be concluded, that the Lord doth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely hate any creature of his own making,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en. 1.31.</note> for they were all good, yea very good: and <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 11.24. <hi>thou loveſt all things that are, and abhorreſt nothing that thou haſt made.</hi> Tis true God hates ſin, becauſe he made it not,, and this hatred hath an influx upon the ſinner, as he is a ſinner, becauſe God made him not ſo: But God hates not a non-elected perſon, or a reprobate, as he is a reprobate, neither doth he condemne him, or decree to condemne him, for his negative reprobation, which is Gods act,<note place="margin">Iſa. 55.8.</note> but for his ſin, which is mans act.</p>
            <p>Secondly I ſay, that this hatred in God (his wayes not being like our waies) is not to be conſidered, as to hold proportion with
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:65253:99"/>
the paſſions and affections of men in their hatred: For this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, or indiſtinct conſideration, or compariſon of divine things with humane, is that great witchcraft that puts ſuch a ſtumbling-blo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k in the way to the knowledge of things, that we cannot diſcover the truth thereof with ſo diſcerning an eye as otherwiſe we might.</p>
            <p>And therefore though I do attribute hatred to God, yet that hatred in God anteceding reprobation, or which is aſſigned as a cauſe of reprobation, is nothing elſe but Gods abſolute will of denying that ſpecial benefit of effectual grace, and infallible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection unto eternal life, and permitting ſome men, by their own defective freewill, deſervedly to fall under the miſery of eternal death. And therefore in ſome ſort I may ſay that the hatred of God is as much viſible, and doth as ſenſibly diſcover it ſelf, in the denyal of effectual grace, as in the inflicting of the torments of hell.</p>
            <p>For God the Father wounded, bruiſed, tormented the ſoul of his dear Son for our ſins, without any diminution of his love unto him: But he never denied him effectual grace, whereby he had an immunity from ſin: And therefore (ſay ſome) It is more deſirable to have the benefit of effectual grace, whereby we are preſerved ſafe in the love of God, than to obtain an immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity from the torments of hell; Chriſt was not exempted from this laſt, though he was never excluded from the former.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I would here diſtinguiſh of the hatred of God, as it ſignifies in him, firſt his affection, or ſecondly his effection (if I may uſe ſuch a word) or otherwiſe the effects of his affection; (though I do confeſs, that theſe affections, as of love, hatred, anger, &amp;c. are not properly in God, but are attributable to him <hi>ex anthropopathia,</hi> by ſimilitude and reſemblance.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for the hatred of God as it is an affection, ſo it doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede Reprobation, it being the will and purpoſe of God to deny grace to ſuch whom he will not elect, which is that whith we call reprobation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the hatred of God, as it ſignifies an effect, to wit, the execution of that hatred, anger, wrath, inflicted on ſinners, and ſo it follows reprobation.</p>
            <p>To ſumme up all in a few words, that God bare leſs love to his creature <hi>Eſau</hi> then to <hi>Iacob,</hi> is manifeſt. That that leſſer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of love which he bare to <hi>Eſau,</hi> may comparatively, to that
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:65253:100"/>
manifeſted to <hi>Iacob,</hi> be called hatred; That God may deny ſome grace to one that he beſtowes upon another, without injuſtice; that equall grace is not given to <hi>Eſau</hi> as to <hi>Iacob;</hi> That thoſe, who from the love of God are not elected, by a neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence muſt be reprobated or not elected,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.4, 5, 6, 7. &amp; 2.4, 5.</note> or loved with a leſſer love. The love of God was the cauſe of our election, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the leſſer love, or hatred, the cauſe of our reprobation.</p>
            <p>And now Sir, if you peruſe this what I have here ſaid, you may eaſily anſwer your own frivolous queſtion.</p>
            <p>And yet I muſt withal tell you, that though I do affirm, that God reprobated <hi>Eſau,</hi> or did not elect him, onely becauſe he would not, it was not the good pleaſure of his will ſo to do, or it was his wil abſolute not to do it, that he denied that favour to him that he ſhewed to <hi>Iacob,</hi> and ſo may be ſaid to hate him without any external cauſe lookt upon as in <hi>Eſau,</hi> why he ſhould be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated rather than <hi>Iacob,</hi> neither of them having done either good or evil: yet there was an internal cauſe of the hatred or reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, namely, the good pleaſure of Gods moſt holy will, for the manifeſtation of his own glory, in his power and juſtice. And therefore God cannot without blaſphemy be compared to the envious Jews, who howſoever they hated the man Chriſt Jeſus without a cauſe, yet God had a cauſe, motive or incentive, from within himſelf, even the manifeſtation of his own glory, in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his power and juſtice on thoſe ſo reprobated; which glory of his is more precious, and to be prefered before the ſaving and preſerving from the torments of hell, the perſons of all both men and Angels: and yet withal I ſay, that the vindictive puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, or poſitive reprobation, which is Gods appointing to torments, and hatred of God, as it is an effect of the former, is never inflicted without a juſt and meritorious cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſin of man. And thus much to what you anſwer to the firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; to the ſecond you write thus.</p>
            <p>[To the ſecond, I have already ſhewed, that <hi>Paul</hi> directed his words to the Jew, who reſted in the law, and made his boaſt of God, and was confident that he was in the way of God, and thence it was that he ſaid, thou wilt ſay unto me, who hath reſiſted his will? But <hi>Paul</hi> had more than the ſingle term, ſin, to aſſigne as a cauſe of their being reprobated, blinded or broken off from their own olive-tree, to wit, a continuance in ſin and unbelief, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the means of ſalvation, <hi>when the hands of the Lord were

               </label> To this I have already anſwered, <hi>pag.</hi> 115. that the words were directed to the Gentiles, to which I refer the Reader. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as afterwards you ſay, that <hi>Paul</hi> had more then that ſingle term to aſſigne as a cauſe of their being reprobated, blinded, broken off, &amp;c. to wit a continuance in ſin and unbelief, and rejecting the means of ſalvation; Sir, this is but <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> you onely ſay, but cannot prove it, ſhew me any ſuch expreſſion in this whole chapter, wherein this text alledged lies, yea, or any where elſe in all the Scripture. It is true thoſe words of yours of the Lords hands ſtretched forth all day long were ſpoken to the <hi>Iſraelites, Rom.</hi> 10.21. <hi>But to Iſrael he ſaith.</hi> But in what place ſoever, ſin, or unbelief, or rejecting of the means, are mentioned as any cauſe of Reprobating, blinding, ſhortning or cutting off, it is ſpoken onely of reprobation in time, which is but the execution of that decree which was determined before all time, and about which immanent act of God, and not theſe tranſient, is our preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. And ſo I leave both theſe objections as yet unreſolved by you, and ſtanding in as full force, for any thing that you have thereunto anſwered, as when they were firſt endited by the Holy Ghoſt, penned by his holy Apoſtle <hi>Paul.</hi> Give in an anſwer to it in the heavens if you can, for you are never able to do it here upon earth.</p>
            <p>And ſo I proceed to the ſixth and laſt Abſurdity, which is this.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Abſurd.</hi> 6. Hereby we confine Gods infinite ſoveraignty over the creatures, to that narrow ſcantling of our ſubordinate power, as though he might not do with his own what he liſt, without our controll, and not make a veſſel either to honour, or diſhonour, unleſs he were accountable to us for a reaſon of his ſo doing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We confine not Gods infinite ſoveraignty over his creatures, to any ſubordinate power in man whatſoever; neither doth any principle that we hold, tend to the limiting <hi>the holy One of Iſrael</hi> in the leaſt, in the diſpoſing his creatures, any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then it ſeemeth good in his good will and pleaſure to do, as hath been by me already made to appear.</p>
            <p>For as I have already granted, ſo I ſay yet again, that God might have left his creature, man, in that loſt condition that his own ſin had brought him into, and needed not to have been countable to any for a reaſon of his ſo doing: But it was meerly
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:65253:101"/>
the good will and pleaſure of our God to be moved onely from that fountain of love that was, and yet is in himſelf, to give forth his Son Chriſt to dye for all, and taſt death for every man; and that all whatſoever was in man, or acted by man, did not merit the leaſt drop of the bloud of Chriſt, but by the grace of God it came freely, and he might have withheld that great mercy from his creature, and needed not in the leaſt have been countable to any for a reaſon of his ſo doing; but through that good pleaſure of God, the Lord Jeſus is that lamb of God that was in the purpoſe and decree of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. <hi>ſlain from the foundation of the world:</hi> which purpoſe and decree of God was put into execution in the fulneſs of time for our everlaſting good; and notwithſtanding, we could not in the leaſt have looked for theſe things from God as a debt, yet it hath been the pleaſure of God by grace, to ſend his Son into the world, and to make known the myſtery of his will in theſe things, and freely to give us an account, or ſhew unto us a reaſon of his ſo doing; which will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear plainly in the reſolving thoſe following queſtions by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs words of the holy Spirit in Scripture, without either infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or comment.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>Wherefore did God give his onely begotten Son, or ſend his Son into the world?</hi>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> For our Juſtification.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and many more of this nature that might be mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are laid down in Scripture as grounds and reaſons, whereby it hath been the pleaſure of God to be accountable unto us where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath done theſe great things for us, not in order to the limitation of himſelf to any ſubordinate power in us, but in order to the accompliſhment of his own will and pleaſure for our good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:65253:101"/>And ſo in like manner Gods diſpoſing of his creature, in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing veſſels of honour, or diſhonour, is not in reſpect of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement of his ſoveraignty over his creatures to any ſubordinate power in us, but the confinement of himſelf therein, is to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, decree, and promiſe, which muſt ſtand and cannot be diſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled; So that the queſtion now is not, What God might have done with his creature being once at liberty; but that which we are to take notice of, is, How he hath diſpoſed, or doth diſpoſe thereof, as having freely, and voluntarily bound and ingaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thereunto by purpoſe, decree, and promiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.27. <hi>for the Lord of hoſts hath purpoſed, and who ſhall diſannul it? his hand is ſtretched out, and who ſhall turn it back?</hi> So that what God, for ought that we know, might have done with his creature, being once at liberty, cannot now by him be done, he having bound himſelf as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Take but this one inſtance for the further illuſtration of this to be a truth: God might, if it had been his pleaſure to have kept himſelf at liberty, for ought that we know, have deſtroyed the world with the waters of a flood, ſince the flood that was in the dayes of <hi>Noah;</hi> but ſince it hath been the pleaſure of God freely to enter into a Covenant with all fleſh, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.9, 10, 11. yea with every living creature, and to make a promiſe that all fleſh ſhould be cut off no more by the waters of a flood, neither ſhould there any more be a flood to deſtroy the earth, therefore now he cannot deſtroy the earth ſo any more, <hi>becauſe he changeth not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can lye.]</hi>

            <p>And therefore in anſwer to what you would ſay, I deal thus plainly, that I do reſolve not to purſue you in this your rambling diſcourſe; you have ſerved us here with a diſh of cockcrowne pottage, whereupon if I ſhould inſiſt to frame an anſwer, it would

but waſt my moſt precious time and nauſeate the Reader; for from this to the end of your Pamphlet, there is nothing of new, but a recapitulation, and vain repetition of what hath been ſpoken to, over and over again, and fully anſwered; Onely one thing about the liberty of the will, which when I meet it in its due place, I ſhall then encounter it. In the mean time, for what is comprehended in this Section, If I ſhould yield you all, I ſhould receive no loſs by it, not your cauſe any advantage, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall diſmiſs it with the appendant queſtion; and anſwers, without further trouble to my ſelf or the Reader.</p>
            <p>Onely let me tell you, that ſo far as I perceive by your diſcourſe, you have not dived into the bottom of the abſurdity contracted to your ſelf by your Poſition, which doth aſſert, that the rejection of that means of ſalvation, <hi>viz.</hi> the free tenders of Chriſt in the Goſpel, and continuing in ſin and unbelief, are the cauſes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, as conceiving it inconſiſtent with the juſtice, mercy, and wiſdom of God to reprobate without theſe cauſes; whereas our conſtant affirmation is, that the ſole good will and pleaſure of God is the alone and ſingle cauſe of non election or negative re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation from eternity, God having that abſolute power over his creature, as that it reſts ſolely in his will, not to elect him, but to ſuffer him to ſin, and ſo to run himſelf into eternal perdition; and that therefore thoſe who are contrary minded, that do ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that this abſolute non election cannot well conſiſt with the divine attributes, as his juſtice, mercy, wiſdom, &amp;c. as you do in your ſtrange acclamation, <hi>p.</hi> 16. Then you do confine the infinite ſoveraignty of God that he hath over his creature, as though he might not do with his own what he liſt without our controll; but (as I have ſhewed) he may either annihilate, or caſt into hell whom he pleaſeth, as Lord Paramount. But to this you have ſpoken nothing at all, as to this reprobation; all that you have ſaid is to a Goſpel declaratory way, that no man gainſayes neither is it the ſubject of this our preſent diſcourſe. But you further write;</p>
            <p>[And ſo it cometh to paſs, that thoſe two different events which do or ſhall befall the ſons of men, which is ſalvation to all that ſort or kind of people that do imbrace the means and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Jeſus Chriſt; and reprobation, and everlaſting deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the other ſort or kind of people that do continue in ſin and unbelief, rejecting the means of ſalvation; and theſe two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

events come to paſs according to that purpoſe and decree of God which was from before the foundation of the world: but the decree of God, which was before time doth not neceſſitate thſe different actings of men that came forth in their generations in time, which is the penitency, faithfulneſs and obedience of thoſe that thereby come to be under the decree of election to everlaſting life; nor the impenitency, unbelief, and diſobedience of thoſe that for that cauſe fall under the decree of reprobation to everlaſting deſtruction; no more then the law and decree that was made by the Governours of this Nation, many ages and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations paſt, concerning the protection of honeſt men, and the puniſhment of them that do evil. But as the decree that was made as aforeſaid many ages and generations paſt, ſince it was made, is yet a tendency and conducement, if it be conſidered of, to lead all men to live honeſtly: So the decree of God that was before time, and publiſhed or made known to the ſons of men in time, is ſo far from the neceſſitating men to do wickedly, <hi>viz.</hi> to continue in ſin and unbelief, and the rejecting of the means of ſalvation, that it is of ſuch tendency and conducement, upon the right conſideration thereof, in reſpect of the great benefit on the one hand, to be the portion of penitent and obedient perſons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Jeſus Chriſt; and the great woe and miſery on the other hand, that doth and will befal all thoſe that continue in ſin and unbelief, and reject the means of ſalvation; that it doth, I ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſidered of, as aforeſaid, tend ſtrongly to the perſwading of all ungodly perſons ſpeedily to break of their ſins by righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and their iniquities by cleaving unto Jeſus Chriſt, in believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and walking in that truth, &amp; undoubtedly they ſhall be ſaved.]</p>

            <p>To what you ſay, that the publiſhed decrees of God are of ſuch a tendency and conducement to the perſwading of men to forſake their ſins and believe in Jeſus Chriſt, I deny not, but that thoſe decrees which are ſo publiſhed in the Scriptures, may be of the like import, as ſome other portions of Scripture are, <hi>viz.</hi> of tendency to perſwade men to forſake their ſins, and believe in Jeſus Chriſt; But I muſt tell you, that they are onely morally and inſtrumentally ſo, and not phyſically; they work onely on the outward man, they cannot change the heart, that is Gods cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of preſence,<note place="margin">Prov. 21.1</note> there is his throne alone, tis he alone that chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth that, and turnes it as the rivers of water.</p>

Pro. 2.14.</note> prone and inclinable to embrace the evil; ſo that man now doth naturally <hi>drink iniquity like water, and make a paſtime of doing evil:</hi> and therefore as <hi>Adams</hi> will was truly good, not onely in the actions, but in the inward qualities thereof: ſo our will is truely and properly corrupt, not onely as to its evil actions, but alſo the inward vicious diſpoſition thereof; And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til ſuch time as God is pleaſed to heal the diſeaſe, and replant in our wills their primitive integrity, they are utterly dead in ſin, captives, and bondſlaves of corruption: So that however they have ſome liberty in naturall, civill, or externall ſpiritual things, yet in regard of true grace and holineſs, they have no liberty at all to chuſe that, but are wholly enthralled unto ſin, according to that of the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.20. <hi>When ye were the ſervants of ſin ye were free from righteouſneſs:</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>The carnal mind is enmity againſt God, for it is not ſubject to the law of God, neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed can be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore the man doth in plain terms give the lye to the Spirit of God ſpeaking in the Scriptures, that dares to affirm that a man in the eſtate of unregeneracy (who without doubt is, if any be, a ſervant of ſin, and carnally minded) is notwithſtanding free unto righteouſneſs, and may be even of his own natural power
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:65253:104"/>
ſubject to the law of God, commanding him faith, and obedience, and that he hath a liberty and power to chooſe grace when it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: ſtrong arguments might be brought to overturn this power upſide down, but I am weary of what is already upon my hands. For the objection that you offer, let thoſe vindicate it whoſoever made it; for my part I do not inſiſt upon it, but ſhall anſwer to that place by you quoted, <hi>Deut.</hi> 39.19. after another manner.</p>
            <p>And I do indeed conceive that this allegation is not any thing <hi>ad rem,</hi> not at all to the buſineſs in hand. For firſt, <hi>Moſes</hi> here ſpeaks unto the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> not as then in a ſtate of ſinful unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, but rather as in a ſtate of grace, for they were then the Church and people of God, and he ſpeaks unto them, as they were a Church, wherein, becauſe of their holy calling, by the law of charity he accounts of them all as in a ſtate of grace; but if any were in a ſtate of unregeneracy (as doubtleſs there were) he counſels them to chooſe life, yet he doth not ſay, that they might have it out of their own ſtrength without ſpecial grace, but this exhortation implicitly teacheth</p>
            <p>Firſt, what duty is incumbent on us, for our part to performe, and yet it doth not acknowledge ſtrength enough in us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the duty.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it ſhews us what is beſt for us, <hi>viz.</hi> to chooſe life rather then death.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, ſuch places are as tutors to us, to informe us of our natural infirmity, when therein we find that we are no waies able to do as we are commanded,<note place="margin">Luk. 17.10.</note> but that when we have done our beſt we are unprofitable ſervants.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, this will be as a ſpur to put us on to prayer, to ſeek that at Gods hands which we cannot compaſs by our own ſtrength; <hi>Da Domine quod jubes, et jube quod vis. Give us, Lord, power to do what thou commandeſt, and then command what thou wilt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, ſuch exhortations the Spirit of God ordinarily makes uſe of in converting of ſinners, there accompanying the inward energetical working and power of the Spirit of God, with the outward miniſtery of the word; it was the power of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Joh. 11.43. Ro. 1.20.</note> and not the bare words of, <hi>Lazarus come forth,</hi> that raiſed him.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, yea ſuch exhortations are uſeful to make the wicked inexcuſable.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, tis to this end, that when the wicked are puniſhed, the juſtice of God might be vindicated.<note place="margin">Iſa. 5.4.</note> What could have been done more?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:65253:105"/>Thoſe two other places, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24.25. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.42. where you ſet out the word <hi>chooſing</hi> in capital letters, as though they would have beheaded al the arguments brought againſt your freewil, yet ſpeak little to the purpoſe, as to a liberty of chooſing that which is good, in a perſon unregenerate; for that they muſt ſpeak, or elſe it were as good that they held their peace, as to your cauſe now in hand. For as for that of <hi>Moſes;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, I look upon him, not as then an unregenerate perſon, but as one of the people and houſhold of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, neither are you ever able to prove that this was his firſt choice as to the waies of God, but that he was better princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled before this.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the choice which he is here ſaid to make was but a meer civil choice, <hi>viz</hi> when <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter had adopted him for her child, when he came to years, and well underſtood his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degree whence his deſcent was, he then diſclaimed this adoptive honour, and was not further willing to diſſemble his nation, and to act for the <hi>Egyptians</hi> againſt his own brethren according to the fleſh, but choſe rather to profeſs himſelf an <hi>Hebrew</hi> of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> though he ſuffered affliction with them: Tis true, its ſaid he had an eye to the recompence of the reward, but then ſurely that muſt be in his heart before ever he could make any ſuch choice; and then what will this place be to the purpoſe as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons unregenerate?</p>
            <p>And for that choice of <hi>Maries</hi> likewiſe, the moſt you can make of it, is but an external ſpiritual good, to chooſe rather to hear a ſermon, than to provide a dinner, to prefer to hear Chriſt preaching, than how ſhe might give him curious entertainment; and this its poſſible for one to do and yet to go to hell after the ſermon is ended.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Mar. 6.20. Act. 12.21</note>
               <hi>Herod</hi> made choice to hear <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> and the text ſaith that he heard him gladly; and yet what became of <hi>Herod</hi> it is an eaſy matter to judge without any breach of charity.</p>
            <p>And thus you ſhake hands at parting with freewill, and return to your in and out diſcourſe after this manner.</p>
            <p>[And thus, when men and women come to repent, and be changed from dead works, and embrace the means of ſalvation, and believe in Jeſus Chriſt, they then come to be ſuch a ſort or kind of people, that it was in the purpoſe and decree of God which was from before the foundation of the world, to elect,

            </p>
            <p>God did not decree to elect and juſtifie and ſave <hi>individuum vagums</hi> or qualifications, to be found no man knows where, nor when, for ſo it might be that for all that election by you imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, yet no man might be ſaved, if no man would believe or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; and indeed no man could, if God did not give them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and give them repentance to ſalvation.

            <p>[And this is that which God hath done, not in order to any confinement of himſelf to any ſubordinate power in us, but in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the doing of that which he purpoſed in Chriſt Jeſus before the world began, for our good: and it hath been the good will and pleaſure of God to be ſo far accountable unto us of theſe things, for our comfort and conſolation in Jeſus Chriſt, that if any ſhall ſay unto us, who be the veſſels of mercy which God hath afore prepared unto glory? that we can ſay, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.24. <hi>even us whom he hath called, not of the Iews onely, but alſo of the Gentiles.</hi> Yea it

               </label> Sir, you onely ſpeak here of Gods not conſining himſelf to any ſubordinate power, but you proſecute not the point as it is laid to your charge.</p>
            <p>We with the Sctiptures do affirm, Gods abſolute purpoſe, or the good pleaſure of his moſt holy will is the alone cauſe of non-election or Reprobation, and not the rejecting of the means, to wit, the free tenders of Chriſt in the Goſpel; and the continuing in ſin and unbelief are not the cauſes as you aſſert, pretending, that if theſe be not aſſigned cauſes, then God would be unjuſt or unmerciful to the creature; hereupon we ſay, that if God may not do with his creature what ſeems beſt to him in his own eyes, without rendring a reaſon of his actings, but that his attributes muſt be called into queſtion, this is to limit and confine the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite ſoveraignty that God hath over all the creation, and to ſuffer worms and duſt to controll majeſty.</p>
            <p>But to this, Sir, hitherto you have ſaid nothing.</p>
            <p>To what you ſay of that place, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.21. that it is the good will and pleaſure of our God, whoſoever they be that delight to embrace the means of ſalvation, and purge themſelves from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, ſin and uncleaneneſs ſhall be veſſels unto honour, is very true, and good in that ſenſe it was intended by the Spirit of God, but neither true nor good in that ſenſe it is by you applied and made uſe of.</p>
            <p>For firſt of all, you ſuppoſe that it is in their own power to purge themſelves from error, ſin, and uncleanneſs, whereas this is Gods peculiar work, to purge us from our ſins, and purely to purge away our droſs and to waſh us with clean water, and to turn us to himſelf, and then we ſhall be ſure to be turned; all our
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:65253:106"/>
ſtrength to performe ſuch a taske is elſe altogether inſufficient.</p>
            <p>Your ſecond couchant error here is, that you conceive this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of themſelves will hereby make them veſſels of honour; but I ſay, this their purging was no cauſe at all of their being veſſels of honour, but it was onely a means of the diſcovery of it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they might have comfort and conſolation.</p>
            <p>Before, even from all eternity, by that decree of election, they were out of that lump of perdition made veſſels unto honour, or veſſels of mercy which God had afore prepared unto glory; but when the times of refreſhing come,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.21.23. Gal. 1.16. Heb. 9.14.</note> and that the Lord is pleaſed to reveal his ſon in them, and that ſuch his ſecret decree comes to be put in execution in time, by God his giving of faith and repentance, and purging their conſciences from dead dead works to ſerve the living God, then they ſhall be veſſels unto honour, unto their own comfort and to the good example of others. Such a manner of ſpeech there is, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Herein is my father glorified, that ye bear much fruit, ſo ſhall ye be my Diſciples.</hi> Now they were his Diſciples before, but the meaning is, that by bearing of fruit they ſhould approve themſelves, both to their own conſciences, and to the world beſides, that they were the Diſciples of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Neither is that which follows altogether ſo ſound, where you write.</p>
            <p>[But on the other hand, in reſpect of what he doth in the making forth of his juſtice in the puniſhment of his creature for ſin and impenitency, he doth it not until he is provoked thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, even 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.16. <hi>untill there is no remedy; for the Lord is, Pſal</hi> 19.1. and 145.8. <hi>ſlow to anger, and of great mercy; and hath, Ezek.</hi> 33.11. <hi>no pleaſure in the death of the wicked.</hi> And therefore although that the embracing of the means, repenting, and believing in Jeſus Chriſt, be no procuring ground or cauſe of any the leaſt mercies we do enjoy; yet the continuing in ſin, and unbelief, and the rejecting of the means of ſalvation, is a procuring of puniſhment: ſee <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Haſt thou not procured this unto thy ſelf, in that thou haſt forſaken the Lord thy God, when he led thee by the way?</hi> alſo <hi>ch.</hi> 4.18. <hi>thy way and thy doings hath procured theſe things unto thee; this is thy wickedneſs, becauſe it reacheth unto thine heart.</hi>]</p>

               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:65253:107"/>Yet where you ſay, that God doth not make forth his juſtice in puniſhing until he be provoked; Sir, I cannot allow you ſo much, to take this univerſally. For, tell me if you can, how thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants had provoked God in the general deluge,<note place="margin">Gen. 7.</note> when they were ſwept away with the reſt of the wicked world: or thoſe infants, in the combuſtion of <hi>Sodom,</hi>

            <p>No Sir, in many caſes there is no viſible provocation, beſides the original depravation of corrupt nature, which through the want of original righteouſneſs doth juſtly deſerve wrath and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.

            <p>But where you ſay, that God gives men liberty to chooſe life, but not in their own time, but in Gods time; I pray Sir, make me acquainted with that myſtery (according as it is held by you) how comes it to paſs, that the will of man is at liberty to chooſe, at ſome times and not at others, and what then becomes of that liberty of choice, when (as you ſay is mans time) that he cannot chooſe?

            <p>That which follows of yours is this.</p>

            <p>And now you are drawing to an end you ſay.</p>

            <p>Sir, it is too too manifeſt, that notwithſtanding what you have here written to guard the authority and credit of your poſitions, yet that this abſurdity with all the reſt of its fellows, are the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed brood of what you here in your poſitions affirmed, and that they will ſtill lye crying at your doors, becauſe you have expoſed them to view, and own them as your own brats, and therefore till you can better acquit your ſelf of them then hitherto you have done (which will never be) you muſt be inforced to father them whether you will or no.</p>

            <p>[Some other poſitions there were written, and ſome of them he ſaith may paſs with a grain of ſalt, and ſome which he doth not well underſtand the meaning of, wanting, as he ſaith, an <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dipus</hi> to unriddle the meaning of uſing ſcorneful and deriding ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, ſaying, the novice leadeth him in a miſt, and the like: and yet he frameth ſome arguments againſt them, ſhooting as he ſaith, at adventure, and yet they fall from him as if they were ſhot againſt the truth: but at preſent not being very well at leiſure, and alſo under the envious dealing of <hi>Satan,</hi> I ſhall let them reſt, and commend what I have here done to conſideration, if he have but the patience to read it with an impartial eye, and with a ſingle and upright mind, without a ſpirit of prejudice againſt it, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the homelineſs of the expreſſions, becauſe they are not full of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. <hi>Excellency of ſpeech, and the inticing words of mans wiſdome,</hi> and Theological expreſſions.

mine own received ſenſe, (and I believe it was yours) I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident you will be never able to frame a better anſwer than you have already againſt what here you have undertaken, which is as much as if you had ſaid nothing.

            <p>For your defect of Theological expreſſions, I cannot wonder at it, for it hath not been your trade (as you call it) you have not been converſant among Divines, neither heard many of their words, nor ſeen much of their writings,<note place="margin">Deut. 32.2.</note> whoſe doctrine drops as the rain, their ſpeech diſtils as the dew, as the ſmall rain upon the tender herb, and as the ſhowres upon the graſs; and if you then be a ſtranger to their Idiome, and can make no uſe of their ſtyle in your deliveries, who can be amazed at it?</p>
            <p>And howſoever I might ſay as well as you, that I have been under the envious dealings of <hi>Satan,</hi> which might have put ſome remora to my proceedings in this anſwer, yet I liſt not ſo to Apologize,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.9.</note> but ſhall commend what I have here done to the grace of God which is ſufficient for me.

               <hi>Thomas Tazwels</hi> QUERIES Counter-queſtioned.</head>
            <p>SIR, when at firſt I ſurveyed over your bundle of Queries, I was divided in my thoughts, whether it was fitteſt for me to undertake an anſwer to them yea or no; Tis true, I did not conceive that they were propoſed by ſuch a one that breathed after ſatisfaction, for then I had been bound in conſcience (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe directed to me) to have given a direct account for the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of a troubled ſpirit; but I was better acquainted with the temper of ſuch Scepticks, Seekers, Queriſters, the top of whoſe Religion conſiſts moſt what in abſtruſe Queſtions: But that which cauſed this diſtraction in me, was, the calling to mind <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> advice, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.4, 5. <hi>Anſwer not a fool, according to his folly, leſt thou alſo be like unto him.</hi> And <hi>Anſwer a fool according to his folly, leſt he be wiſe in his own conceit;</hi> So that which way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I did addreſs my ſelf, I was ſure to be gored by one of the hornes of that <hi>Dilemma.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore I did the rather make choice of a middle way, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther directly to anſwer to any of your queries, nor yet to leave
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:65253:110"/>
any of them unreſolved, but when I apprehended them as capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Queſtions, more to try abilities, then to expect ſatisfaction, I thought it beſt to follow our Saviours example, <hi>Mark</hi> 12.13. Who when the primates <hi>of the Phariſees had ſent unto him certain of that ſect, with the Herodians, to catch him, and intangle him in his words,</hi> they began firſt by inſinuation, <hi>Maſter, we know that thou art true, and careſt for no man, for thou regardeſt not the perſons of men, but teacheſt the way of God in truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, by queſtion, <hi>Is it lawful to give tribute to Caeſar or not?</hi> ſhall we give, or ſhall we not give?</p>
            <p>But Chriſt, who was privy to the ſecret guil of their hearts, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring a penny to be brought him, askes them this queſtion, <hi>Whoſe is this Image and ſuperſcription? they ſay Caeſars;</hi> then ſaith he, <hi>give unto Caeſar the things that are Caeſars, and unto God the things that are Gods;</hi> ſo that he makes no direct anſwer, but by a Queſtion.</p>
            <p>The like may you ſee <hi>Mark</hi> 11.28, 29. when the chief Prieſts and Scribes askt of Chriſt, <hi>by what authority doſt thou theſe things? Ieſus anſwered, I will alſo ask you one queſtion, and anſwer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do theſe things, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The like courſe I ſhall take with you; I have not poſitively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered my judgement to any of your queries, but for the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them have ſet down antiqueſtions, to which if you give a direct anſwer according to the Scripture, you muſt then needs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer your ſelf to all thoſe of your own queries. So that making Chriſt his practiſe a preſident to my ſelf, I ſhall both follow his example, and withall obſerve the wiſe mans direction, both to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer a fool in his folly, and yet not to anſwer a fool in his folly, <hi>viz.</hi> implicitly and conſequentially to anſwer by a queſtion, but poſitively and directly not to anſwer to the words.</p>

            <p>SIR, I need not tell you what trouble you have put me to, in purſuing you in all this your rambling diſcourſe and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Queries, for it is very viſible; and yet (againſt the diſſwaſion of ſome friends) I have willingly gone thorow with it, not ſo much in any hopes that I had for the recalling of a back-ſlider, by a better information of him; for tis too well experienced that men of your jump, they will ſooner precipitate themſelves into a hundred new errors, then to retract one; an eaſie obſervation will clear this for a truth. But indeed the greateſt motives I had for the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this task, were, Firſt, the glory of the moſt high God, that his precious truths might not be perverted by your lies, but that his glory might ſhine all the world over, as well in the execution of juſtice, as manifeſtation of mercy, and that in both he might be all in all, and all his works of creation might be ſubſervient to his good pleaſure and moſt righteous will. The next thing I had in mine eye was a tender love I bore to a number of poor ſimple ſouls, whom you had dipt, and plunged into your faith, and were almoſt <hi>jurati in verba magiſtri,</hi> receiving your crude dictates as ſo many Oracles; and for their ſakes did I likewiſe draw this bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den on myſelf, that by unkennelling you out of your Fox-holes, I might uncaſe you and turn your inſide out, and ſo disfranchiſe you of all thoſe ſtrong holds and ſubterfuges wherein formerly you truſted,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.6</note> and therewith deluded and <hi>led captive many ſilly women la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with ſins</hi> (for moſt of that ſex were your over-credulous Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors) that ſo they beholding your nakedneſs, they might be aſhamed for leaning on and truſting to ſuch bruiſed reeds as your

rotten Poſitions were. And now I have done, one word of adviſe I have to give you, which is this, that neither you nor any of your comrads ſhould be much ſollicitous for any reply unto my writings; for it is already by me reſolved, that whatſoever your further under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings ſhall be in this kind, or howſoever you ſhall be a provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to me, yet I will not <hi>Serram trahere,</hi> not bandy words any more with you, nor ſhew my ſelf ſo effeminate as to ſtrive for the laſt word, for ſo <hi>there would be no end of making of books;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12.12.</note> and if this that I have written will not do it, I conceive no leſs then an Omnipotent hand will ever be able to alter your judgement. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I have waſted ſo much precious time on you already, that now I muſt endeavour to redeem it, and that ſo theſe controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal points being laid aſide, I may with more intention bend my ſtudies,<note place="margin">Pſal. 9.10. 2 Tim. 4.6.</note> not onely for the diſcharge of my particular calling in diſpenſing of the Goſpel of grace; but alſo, ſince I have almoſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the period of mans age, and therefore (in natural account) the time of my departure being at hand, it will be of more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to me, to ſpend the remainder of my ſpare time in this my ſhort pilgrimage, in acts of practical devotion, and to wave polemical conteſts; that ſo ſetting before my eyes that great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that muſt be paſt before that great Tribunall, I may conſider before hand, <hi>how I may do it with joy and not with grief.</hi>

            <p>But if you or any elſe ſhall object againſt me that I have been too harſh in dealing ſo homely and roundly with you, perſonating rather a ranting Quaker, then a ſober Divine; all that I have to ſay for my ſelf is this, and yet I hope this is ſatisfactory enough to the wiſe and judicious, that my plain dealing proceeded not from any enmity I bear to your perſon, God he knoweth it, for I ſhall be ſtill ready to do you any office of love, but meerly out of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation that I had againſt your writings, which did ſo deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench upon the Majeſty of God and his glorious Attributes.</p>
            <p>Yet in this life I acknowledge (and therefore I rather pity then malice you) there is not an equal diſcovery to all men in a like meaſure, but to ſome more, to ſome leſs; the Talents are not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed by God after a Geometrical proportion, all are not teachers, there muſt be ſome hearers, for the Oeconomy of the Church of God. But ſure my hopes are, that if you belong to God, that in ſome of thoſe whereabouts our conteſt hath been, <hi>where you have been otherwiſe minded</hi> then my ſelf,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.15.</note> 
               <hi>that God will reveal even thoſe things unto you.</hi>

               <hi>Elias cum venerit, ſolvet omnia, When Chriſt who is our life ſhall appear in his glory, and that this corruptible hath put on incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and this mortal ſhall have put on immortality,</hi> though now we may be of different judgements, and jar and wrangle amongſt our ſelves, yet then (if we appertain to Chriſt) both you and I ſhall be made real friends, and mutually agree in the harmonious conſort of that heavenly quire, <hi>in ſinging the ſongs of the Lamb, ſaying,</hi>
